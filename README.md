# Stephen Smith: Hit and Run Victim, Vehicular Homicide, or Murder?

Stephen Smith was an openly gay nineteen year old male born and raised in Hampton, South Carolina. He was discovered dead on a rural road at night on July 8, 2015. The coroner specified that his death was a hit and run, although the South Carolina Carolina Highway Patrol disagreed with the autopsy results. His death was classified as a hit-and-run. During the investigation of Paul and Maggie Murdaugh Murders, new information led SLED[^1] to reopen his death as a murder investigation.
