|Investigators’ bid to solve last week’s double homicide draws fresh scrutiny on 2015 cold case …|
|Days after the shocking double homicide of Paul Murdaugh and his mother Maggie Murdaugh, FITSNews published an exclusive report about three other deaths that have connections to the powerful South Carolina family.|
|One of those deaths? The case of Stephen Smith — a 19-year-old man from Hampton, S.C. who was found dead in the middle of Sandy Run Road on July 8, 2015. Investigators with the S.C. Highway Patrol (SCHP) received multiple tips in the aftermath of Smith’s death linking his untimely demise to the Murdaugh family.|
|Officially, Smith’s death was classified as a hit and run.|
|Six years later, Sandy Smith — Stephen’s mother — is still grappling with the pain of not knowing what happened to her son.|
|On Thursday, Sandy Smith said she received a call from an official with the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED). She was hoping to hear that they had opened a case in her son’s unsolved death. *“They called me back and said they were looking into Stephen’s case because they have to see if my family is involved in the shooting of Paul and Maggie (Murdaugh),”* Sandy Smith said. *“What a slap in the face.”* |
|Sandy has been begging law enforcement officials for years to open an investigation into her son’s unsolved death. She was devastated to hear the news that she and her family were now being viewed as possible persons of interest in the savage slayings last Monday at Moselle — the Murdaugh family hunting lodge in Colleton county.|
|In the aftermath of her son’s death, Sandy said she’s learned that there are two different justice systems in the Palmetto State — one for people like the Murdaughs and another for everyone else. *“They just don’t care about the poor people who can’t afford to hire a big-time attorney or private investigators*, Sandy said. *“They just throw their cases on a shelf to collect dust.”* |
|The Murdaugh family has loomed large in the Lowcountry for nearly a century — with three generations of its members serving as solicitor (South Carolina’s version of a district attorney) over a five-county region between 1920 and 2007. Two Murdaughs also work for the prominent Hampton, S.C. law firm of Peters, Murdaugh, Parker, Eltzroth and Detrick (PMPED). |
|SLED is continuing to cast a wide net as it looks to exclude individuals in connection with the double homicide that took place at the Murdaugh’s 1,700-acre hunting property located near Islandton, S.C. on the evening of June 7, 2021. Earlier this week, the agency opened up a tip line exclusively for the high-profile case. |
|Of course, the fact SLED is interviewing Sandy Smith means it is taking seriously the suggestion that the Murdaugh family may have had something to do with the death of her son. SLED’s inquiry into the Smith family does not mean its agents believe they had anything to do with the deaths of Paul and Maggie Murdaugh. SLED is simply looking at anyone who may have had a possible motive in the case — including the survivors of a high-profile February 2019 boat crash that killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach.|
|Beach died when a 17-foot center console fishing boat allegedly driven by an inebriated Paul Murdaugh slammed into a pylon near the Archer’s Creek bridge on February 24, 2019 around 2:25 a.m. Murdaugh was charged with three felony counts of boating under the influence (BUI) in the aftermath of that crash. According to our sources, all of the boat crash survivors — and Beach’s family members — voluntarily submitted to questioning and volunteered to provide their DNA as a part of the double homicide investigation. A source close to the family also told FITSNews that the Beaches have not been questioned again since providing their statements and DNA.|
|SLED is investigating every angle in the Murdaugh case — something that Sandy wishes they would have done with Stephen’s death six years ago.|
|In fairness, SLED didn’t investigate Stephen’s case because it was dubiously ruled a hit and run. No homicide investigation was ever opened, and no referral was ever made to the agency in the case. Sandy Smith was told that if she wanted her son’s case to be looked at by SLED, she would have to write a letter.|
| **What Happened to Stephen Smith?** |
|Like the probe of the 2019 boat crash that killed Mallory Beach, the 2015 investigation into Smith’s death was chaotic from the beginning — clouded by jurisdictional confusion and suspicions of investigative interference.|
|Smith was found dead just before 4:00 a.m. EDT on July 8, 2015. Crime scene photos obtained by FITSNews are horrific — Stephen’s entire face was covered in blood that cascaded from a 7.25-inch gaping hole on the right side of his forehead. His head was misshapen by blunt force. Someone just left him in the middle of the road to die …|
|Stephen’s massive head wound — along with the lack of other significant injuries on his body — stumped investigators on scene. His right shoulder was partially dislocated. Cuts and bruises dotted his right hand. His loosely tied shoes were still on and his clothes appeared untouched. His phone and keys were still in his pocket.|
|Investigators found Smith’s car three miles away on the side of Bamberg Highway. His wallet was inside the car. SCHP detectives noted the car’s gas cap was unscrewed and hanging outside of the gas cap door. Law enforcement officers believed Smith ran out of gas and started walking home before he was killed.|
|Officials couldn’t nail down a cause or manner of death. At first, they thought it was a hit and run. Then, the coroner ruled the death a shooting homicide — forcing investigators to search the rural road carved between a tree line and a corn field.|
|In their search, investigators from SCHP, the Hampton County sheriff’s office, and SLED found virtually no evidence — no bullets, no gunshot residue, no tire marks, no debris from a vehicle.|
|Nothing … |
| **Stephen’s Autopsy** |
|Hours later, a pathologist at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) — Dr. Erin Presnell — ruled that Stephen was killed in a hit-and-run accident, a decision which was met with confusion and skepticism by investigators and those who knew Stephen.  Investigators theorized that the mirror of a semi-truck hit Stephen’s head. This decision to rule his death a hit-and-run appeared to skew the investigation by SCHP’s Multi-disciplinary Accident Investigation Team (MAIT) – who typically investigate accidents, not murders.|
|In a report by Todd Proctor, a MAIT detective for SCHP, it was clear that investigators didn’t agree with the pathologist’s conclusion to rule the death a hit and run. It was also clear from the report that there was tension between Presnell and SCHP. He said another investigator *“had already had, from (his) understanding a heated conversation with her about this issue.”* 
|On July 22, 2015, Proctor visited Presnell at MUSC to *“get some sort of clarification”* on the Smith case. Proctor wrote that Presnell spoke in a *“negative tone”* and *“basically called (him) a liar”* when he said that he’d already spoken to Hampton County Coroner Ernie Washington. *“I asked her why she stated that in the report and her answer was ‘because he was found in the road,'”* Proctor wrote. *“She had no evidence other than that for the statement being put in the report.”* Proctor said that he explained to her that law enforcement officers *“had no evidence of this individual being struck by a vehicle.”* *“As I was leaving she stated that the report was preliminary and it was my job to figure out what struck him, not hers,”* Proctor wrote.|
|In August 2015, the coroner told Proctor that he did not agree with the final autopsy results in the Stephen Smith case. The final autopsy report said that Stephen’s cause of death was blunt head trauma, motor vehicle crash, pedestrian vs. vehicle. It said the manner of death (which is either homicide, accident, natural, suicide, or undetermined) was still undetermined. *“The pathologist also states in the report, that in light of historical information along with the autopsy, these conclusions were made,”* Proctor wrote. *“To what historical information she possessed, I am unaware.”* |
|Proctor then spoke with Kelly Greene, Hampton County deputy coroner and a SLED agent — who both attended the autopsy — and said they didn’t make any reference to the pathologist about the victim being struck by a vehicle, only that he was found in the road. Proctor also wrote in his report that Greene was fired sometime between July 22 – August 18 2019. According to the autopsy, Greene was responsible for evidence transfer in the case.|
|Stephen’s friends and family also disputed the autopsy report. Stephen was sharp and hyper-aware of his surroundings. A toxicology report showed that Stephen was completely sober at the time of his death.|
|*“Stephen was not stupid,”* Stephen’s friend told FITSNews. *“There is no way that would happen to him. He would not let a car, let alone a truck, get close enough to hit him. That did not happen to my friend. He doesn’t deserve that. He doesn’t deserve people to think that.”* |
|Stephen was beloved. He was an openly gay young man in the small town of Hampton, South Carolina, which wasn’t easy, but he made the best of it, his friends told FITSNews. He was bright and determined to make a better life for himself. He was in school for nursing at the time of his death.|
| **Murdaugh Connection** |
|The Murdaugh name was mentioned over 40 times throughout the course of the investigation – which went cold less than a year after Smith was killed. To be fair, police appeared to be pursuing other persons of interest as well and never named anyone as a suspect.|
|According to the investigation file, Buster was rumored to have been linked to Stephen — intimately — but detectives never proved this connection. It’s also unclear if the MAIT team ever examined Stephen’s phone, which was tossed between agencies before it was finally unlocked by the FBI several years after his death.|
|After interviewing several sources who knew the Murdaugh brothers, SCHP detective Proctor made some significant assessments of the family. FITSNews obtained all audio from the investigation file. 
*“I think it’s a situation when you grow up and your family is kinda high-profile and you get away with some things because of your family name,”* Proctor said in 2015. *“You become invincible in a way and you get a little liquor and you think you’re untouchable.”* |
|Keep in mind, this is years before Paul Murdaugh was charged with three felonies in the boat crash that killed Mallory Beach.

|Keep in mind, this is years before Paul Murdaugh was charged with three felonies in the boat crash that killed Mallory Beach.|
|At another point in the investigation, Proctor appeared frustrated that local sources were hesitant and scared to speak of the Murdaughs to police. *“The Murdaughs, as big and powerful and rich as everyone thinks they are … they’re going to go on living their lives like nothing (happened),”* Proctor said. *“So they can play that card like they care about everyone else. No they don’t… they care about protecting themselves.”* |
|Proctor made it clear in his reports that he didn’t believe Stephen’s death was a hit-and-run. *“We’re not classifying this as anything other than a murder,”* Proctor said in an audio recording. *“You go back to the Murdaugh name and their ties in that community, and that don’t matter to me… What we’ve done is take that investigation out of that and their reach… I don’t care what your name is and how much money you got.”* He then said *“I’m not saying that the Murdaugh boy did it.”* *“But if we’re going to be throwing out names, I’m not going to be withholding names,”* Proctor wrote. *“His name is going to be right there with everyone else’s name and I don’t care who knows it.”* |
| **Stephen’s Mother Begs for Help** |
|In September 2016, Stephen’s mother — Sandy Smith — wrote a letter to lawmakers and police agencies pleading for help and claiming corruption in the investigation. *“It has been apparent from the first week of the investigation that authorities are covering up critical evidence and we no longer know who to trust,”* Smith wrote. In the letter, she said 8that they were told that the Murdaugh brothers were involved in her son’s death. She also said she believed that the Murdaughs’ influence extended to all realms of the investigation and was initially tainted when it was ruled a hit-and-run incident.
She said there appeared to be missing evidence in the case — such as the DNA under Stephen’s fingernails, the clothes he was wearing, and the rape kit. *“The case was mysteriously bounced from investigator to investigator without reasons or notification,”* Sandy Smith wrote in the letter. *“It would repeatedly get to a certain point, then the assigned investigator would bow out, perhaps not wanting to take on Solicitor Murdaugh.”* |
|Six years later, Stephen’s case is still unsolved. Sandy told FITSNews she’s still clinging to hope — even after Thursday’s heart-wrenching news. She is working writing an official letter to SLED. While reporters from all over the nation contacted her last week about her son’s story, she just wants the official call from law enforcement telling her they reopened the case. *“I’m tired of them putting Stephen on the back burner,”* Sandy Smith told FITSNews. *“Stephen’s life mattered, too.”* |

COLUMBIA — A search for suspects in the high-profile Murdaugh killings has reignited police interest in two other deaths with ties to the prominent Lowcountry family. The State Law Enforcement Division has opened an investigation into the unsolved death of 19-year-old Stephen Smith, whose body was found in July 2015 in Hampton County, spokesman Tommy Crosby said. Information gathered as part of the Murdaugh double-murder case in Colleton County prompted the agency to open the new investigation. Meanwhile, a grand jury has been empaneled to investigate possible officer misconduct during the investigation of the 2019 boat crash that killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach, according to multiple sources.|
|Paul Murdaugh, who was fatally shot June 7 along with his mother, Maggie, was criminally charged with crashing the boat into a bridge while intoxicated. The Attorney General’s Office said the charges against Paul Murdaugh would be dropped as soon as the agency received official documentation of his death. But agency spokesman Robert Kittle confirmed last week that the overall investigation into Beach’s death is still ongoing. He declined to discuss it in detail. An attorney for the Beach family issued a statement last week saying that the family hoped the attorney general would *“prosecute any improprieties related to any attempts by any member of law enforcement to influence the original criminal investigation.”* An attorney for another passenger in the boat said he was encouraged the state was looking into *“the inexplicable disappearance of important evidence and other lapses by the initial investigating authorities.”* |
|Paul’s uncles John Marvin and Randy Murdaugh denied the family had influenced the crash investigation in an ABC interview that aired June 17. The Murdaugh family has reportedly been trying to arrange the offer of a $100,000 reward leading to the arrest and conviction of those involved in the fatal shooting of Paul Murdaugh, 22, and his mother, Maggie, 52, at the family’s hunting lodge near Islandton. SLED and Crime Stoppers are said to have balked at handling a reward that large, so the family is working on an alternative solution, according to a source familiar with the matter. Crosby did not immediately have a comment to offer on a possible reward. Crime Stoppers of Lowcountry could not be reached for comment, but the organization’s website states it offers maximum rewards of $1,000 for information. |
| **Stephen Smith** |
|Smith was found dead the morning of July 8, 2015, in the middle of Sandy Run Road near Joe Miley Road in Hampton, according to state Highway Patrol investigative records obtained by The Post and Courier through a Freedom of Information Act request.  Details at the scene suggested Smith was not killed in a hit-and-run accident. Investigators noted there was no vehicle debris or skid marks on the road. Smith suffered blunt-force trauma to the head, but his loosely tied shoes remained on his feet, records state. Authorities initially suspected Smith had been shot in the head, but that didn’t turn out to be the case. In a preliminary report, a pathologist suggested Smith was possibly struck by a passing motor vehicle’s mirror, causing his injury and death. Investigators disagreed with the assessment, records state, which led to “heated” discussions. |
|A lance corporal asked the pathologist whether it was possible a person wielding a baseball bat had struck Smith from a moving vehicle. The pathologist told the corporal it was possible, but it was his job to figure out what struck him, not hers, records state.  Investigators chased numerous tips in the investigation, including some involving members of the Murdaugh family, but the case remains unsolved. |
|Smith, a 2014 graduate of Wade Hampton High School in Hampton, was attending OC Tech of Orangeburg and was studying to become a registered nurse at the time of his death, according to his obituary. Authorities suspected he was struck by a semi-truck while walking on the two-lane road after running out of gas. Investigators found his car parked a few miles away, with the gas tank hatch open and the gas cap hanging from the side. His wallet was still inside the locked car, which would not start, records stated. |
|His mother, Sandy Smith, told The Augusta Chronicle in 2015 the scenario envisioned by police didn’t make sense, as her son would have jumped out of the way of an oncoming truck. *“The way his body was laying in the road, with his arm dislocated and bent back behind his body, I just don’t believe that he was struck by the mirror of a vehicle,”* she told the newspaper. 
Attempts to reach Sandy Smith June 23 were unsuccessful. |
| **Mallory Beach** |
|When he was 19, Paul Murdaugh was charged with boating under the influence causing death and two lesser offenses in connection with allegations that he piloted a boat into a bridge near Beaufort while intoxicated, causing Beach’s death. On Feb. 24, 2019, Paul Murdaugh and five friends went boating from an oyster roast north of Beaufort to a Murdaugh family house on the Chechessee River south of town, court records state. The group, who had been consuming alcohol throughout the day, stopped in downtown Beaufort at Paul’s insistence to buy shots of liquor, according to testimony from his friends. On their way back to the family house, Paul Murdaugh slammed the boat into a bridge connecting Parris Island to the rest of Beaufort County. All of the passengers were flung into the creek. Beach did not come up from the water. Her body was recovered a week later. |
|Paul Murdaugh was awaiting trial in that case at the time of his slaying. Paul and his mother were shot to death with separate guns on the grounds of the family’s sprawling property known as Moselle, which sits near the Salkehatchie River along the border of Colleton and Hampton counties. Authorities have released scant details about the episode and no suspects have been named in the slayings. Earlier this week, SLED released heavily redacted reports from their investigation of the case. The Post and Courier filed a lawsuit June 17 against the Colleton County Sheriff’s Office and SLED accusing the two agencies of violating the S.C. Freedom of Information Act in the double-murder investigation. SLED has set up a tip line for the Murdaugh case. Tips can be submitted by calling 803-896-2605. |

|Investigation files revealed (part one)….|
an investigation into the death of Stephen Smith — a Hampton County teenager whose death has been unsolved since 2015. SLED opened the investigation *“based on information gathered during the course of the double murder investigation of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh,”* SLED spokesperson Tommy Crosby told FITSNews.|
|Now, Stephen Smith‘s case is getting national attention and his mother Sandy finally has hope for a fair investigation that will lead to answers in her son’s unsolved death. *“I’ve been waiting on this day for 2,174 days,”* Sandy told FITSNews. *“Thank you, God!”* Sandy Smith told FITSNews that SLED is investigating her son’s death as a homicide — which is something she wishes they did six years ago.|
|Like the probe of the 2019 boat crash that killed Mallory Beach, the 2015 investigation into Smith’s death was chaotic from the beginning — clouded by jurisdictional confusion and suspicions of investigative interference. |
|On July 8, 2015 Stephen Smith was found dead in the middle of Sandy Run Road with a 7.25-inch gaping hole on the right side of his forehead and no other major injuries. Todd Proctor, former South Carolina Highway Patrol investigator, told Fox News this week that it looked like Stephen’s body was placed in the middle of the road.|
|As SLED begins its probe into Stephen’s death, it’s important to look back on the 2015 investigation to see what went awry. Even Dr. Erin Presnell, a pathologist at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), didn’t give much information to police about what led her to decide a motor vehicle killed Stephen.|
|So why didn’t they investigate Stephen’s death as a homicide?|
| **TIMELINE — Part 1** |

| *“In light of historical information and the autopsy findings, it is the opinion of the pathologist that the decedent died as the result of blunt head trauma sustained in a motor vehicle crash in which the decedent was a pedestrian struck by a vehicle,”* the autopsy report says.|
|1:43 p.m. SLED: Agents leave MUSC and take evidence to their forensic laboratory|
| **July 8, 2015 — Evening** |
| **SCHP OFFICIALS APPEAR SKEPTICAL OF THE AUTOPSY RULING** |
|4:15 p.m. SCHP: Sgt. Moore is called by Cpl. David Rowell, of the SCHP, who tells him that Hampton County Sheriff T.C. Smalls called him and told him that the autopsy showed Smith’s death a result of a hit and run.|
|• Moore calls Smalls.|
|• Smalls tells him that *“the doctor was ruling it a motor vehicle accident and they were turning it over to us.”* |
|• Moore then calls Singleton and asks for *“any notes or information he had.”* |
|• Singleton tells Moore he wasn’t at his desk and would call him back in 30 minutes.|
|4:40 p.m. SCHP: Moore calls Washington and asks him if the hit-and-run was his ruling as well.|
|*“He stated he would have to go with the doctor’s ruling,”* Moore wrote. *“I then reminded him that earlier that morning they were certain it was a gunshot wound and he told me he had to go by the opinion of the doctor.”* Moore asks where Smith’s body is. Washington tells him it’s been taken to the funeral home per the family’s wishes at the time of the death notification.|
|SCHP: Moore calls Peeples-Rhoden Funeral Home and speaks with a funeral home director.|
|• He asks the funeral home director if he has the clothing Smith was wearing and is told it was in a paper bag with the body.|
|• Moore instructs him to immediately stop their preparations on the body and “cover him up.” Moore tells Rowell to go get the clothing.|
|5:57 p.m. SCHP: Moore calls King *“to advise him what was occurring.”* |
|SCHP: Moore calls Presnell *“to try and understand”* what made her decide Stephen was killed in a hit and run.|
|*“She said that it was not a gunshot wound and no bullet or fragments were found during the X-ray and that it didn’t look like a bullet wound in her opinion and that since the body was found in the roadway, she could only theorize that it had to be a motor vehicle that caused the death,”* Moore’s note said|
|Moore asks about any other injuries on Smith, and Presnell tells him *“only a partial dislocated right shoulder.”* |
|He asks Presnell if she found any glass fragments or any other evidence of a motor vehicle and *“she stated no.”* |
| *“I then asked her why she was ruling it as a motor vehicle accident and what she thought caused the head injury,”* he wrote. *“She told me it was not her job to figure that out, it was mine.”* |
|6:14 p.m. SCHP: Brock notifies Booker that *“the victim did not have a gunshot wound according to the autopsy.”* Booker contacts Burns and Moore *“to gather further information”* |
|SCHP: Moore calls Singleton again when Singleton doesn’t call him back. He gets voicemail. He instead calls Smalls to see if he can get the information. Smalls said he’ll call right back but doesn’t. So Moore calls Smalls again and gets voicemail.|

|• The family was skeptical of Randy Murdaugh’s offer and thought it was weird.|
|• Duncan does not include this in his case notes.|
|Stephen’s relative tells him that she just officially left the house for the first time since Stephen’s death the day before and went to the store and a bunch of people kept coming up to her saying *“Did you know the Murdaugh Boys are behind it, saying Buster Murdaugh the, one we went to school with did it, and some of his friends.”* |
|Stephen’s family member didn’t seem to believe this at the time.|
|*“I’m just sitting here like ‘why?’ It makes no sense,”* she said. *“He’s never said anything bad about Stephen. He’s never been around Stephen.”* |

|Shortly after 1 p.m. SCHP: Duncan calls Stephen Smith’s mother Sandy Smith. Sandy says she’s skeptical of the man claiming to be Stephen’s boyfriend. She tells police Stephen was going to school in Orangeburg and hung out at Bobcat Landing a lot recently. She said Stephen had been recently cutting school, which was unusual for him. Sandy says that Stephen was smart and a *“study person”* who was typically serious about school. Sandy mentions that a man at Bi-Lo was *“giving Stephen trouble,”* but they became friends. Sandy told Duncan that she heard rumors about the Murdaugh boys had something to do with Stephen’s death.|
| *“The rumor that’s going around Hampton that everybody keeps coming up to me and saying it was Murdaugh boys,”* she says.|
|Duncan responds *“The Murdaugh boys?”* |
| *“Yes. Whoever they are,”* she tells Duncan.|
|Duncan didn’t ask any follow-up questions and never mentioned this rumor in his notes.|
| **July 22, 2015** |
| **AUTOPSY DISPUTE** |
|July 22, 2015, SCHP: Proctor visits Presnell at MUSC to *“get some sort of clarification”* on the Smith case. Proctor wrote that Presnell spoke in a *“negative tone”* and *“basically called (him) a liar”* when he said that he’d already spoken to Hampton County Coroner Ernie Washington. *“I asked her why she stated that in the report and her answer was ‘because he was found in the road,’”* Proctor wrote. *“She had no evidence other than that for the statement being put in the report.”* Proctor said that he explained to her that law enforcement officers *“had no evidence of this individual being struck by a vehicle.”* *“As I was leaving she stated that the report was preliminary and it was my job to figure out what struck him, not hers,”* Proctor wrote.|
| **August 18, 2015** |
| **CORONER SAID HE DOESN’T AGREE WITH THE FINAL AUTOPSY** |
|August 18, 2015, SCHP: The coroner tells Proctor that he did not agree with the final autopsy results in the Stephen Smith case. The final autopsy report said that Stephen’s cause of death was blunt head trauma, motor vehicle crash, pedestrian vs. vehicle. It said the manner of death (which is either homicide, accident, natural, suicide, or undetermined) was still undetermined.|
|*“The pathologist also states in the report, that in light of historical information along with the autopsy, these conclusions were made,”* Proctor wrote. *“To what historical information she possessed, I am unaware.”* Proctor then spoke with Kelly Greene, Hampton County deputy coroner and a SLED agent — who both attended the autopsy — and said they didn’t make any reference to the pathologist about the victim being struck by a vehicle, only that he was found in the road. Proctor also wrote in his report that Greene was fired sometime between July 22 – August 18, 2015. According to the autopsy, Greene was responsible for evidence transfer in the case. *“The coroner stated that he had made contact with the pathologist, Dr. Presnell and she stated that she would be willing to change her report to read however he wanted it,”* Proctor wrote.|

| **[Stephen Smith Case Files: What Happened To The Investigation In 2015? \| Part 2](https://www.fitsnews.com/2021/07/14/stephen-smiths-case-files-what-happened-to-the-investigation-in-2015-part-2/)** |
|More revealed in the mystery…|
| Sandy Smith remembers every detail about her son Stephen’s birth. Stephen Nicolas Smith was born 2 pounds, 12 oz at 7:05 a.m. on January 29, 1996. Unlike his twin sister who was born healthy, Stephen was given a 50 percent chance of survival. *“He overcame the odds, and he survived thanks to milkmaid who provided extra breast milk,”* Sandy Smith previously told FITSNews. *“He always (joked) his brain came from her.”* |
|Stephen was always a bright kid. *“His room was a library…. Every dollar he got from chores, he’d be buying books,”* Sandy Smith previously told FITSNews. *“He was so smart and he always had a dream of being a doctor.”* Stephen was always studious and had plans on becoming a nurse before he could afford medical school. In fact, Stephen was in class at Orangeburg Technical College on the night before he died on July 8, 2015.|
|Now, more than six years after Stephen Smith was found dead in the middle of a rural Hampton County, South Carolina road, Sandy Smith still wants to know details about her son’s death — any piece of information that could help get her son justice. But this year, when the anniversary of Stephen’s death passed, his family finally has some some hope for answers.|
|On June 22, FITSNews exclusively reported that South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) opened an investigation into the death of Stephen Smith — a Hampton County teenager whose death has been unsolved since 2015. SLED opened the investigation *“based on information gathered during the course of the double murder investigation of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh,”* SLED spokesperson Tommy Crosby told FITSNews.|
|Since that news broke, Stephen Smith‘s case has received national attention and his case has been mentioned in nearly every major newspaper in the county. *“The media just wants a story,”* Sandy Smith told FITSNews, referring to invasive national news outlets. *“I just want justice.”* |
|Like the probe of the 2019 boat crash that killed Mallory Beach, the 2015 investigation into Smith’s death was chaotic from the beginning — derailed by jurisdictional obscurity and suspicions of investigative interference. As SLED begins its probe into Stephen’s death, it’s important to look back on the 2015 investigation to see what went awry.|
| **Evidence from the scene** |
|• Smith was found dead just before 4:00 a.m. on July 8, 2015 in the middle of Sandy Run Road in Hampton County, South Carolina.| 
|• No tire marks or no debris from a vehicle found on scene after several searches.|
|• Stephen’s loosely tied shoes were on his feet when he was found dead in the middle of the road.|
|• His car was found three miles away on Bamberg Highway with the gas cap off|
|• Chain of custody apparently was broken when Stephen’s clothes were left unattended at the funeral home.|
|• Stephen’s head was bruised and misshapen by blunt force. His shoulder was partially dislocated, and had no other major injuries.|
| **Dispute about the hit-and-run theory** |
|• Investigators on scene July 8, 2015 went back and forth between a gunshot homicide and hit and run accident|
|• South Carolina Highway Patrol (SCHP) officers were told it wasn’t a vehicular accident they didn’t have to be at the autopsy|
|• At the autopsy, MUSC pathologist Dr. Erin Presnell ruled that Stephen was killed in a hit-and-run crash.|
|• Two SCHP investigators who spoke with Presnell described hostile experiences with the pathologist and couldn’t get a direct answer for why she ruled Stephen’s death a vehicle accident.|
|• The coroner said he didn’t believe Stephen’s death was a hit and run.|
|• The case was given to SCHP (until 2021, when SLED opened an investigation)|
| **TIMELINE — Part 2** |
| **July 21, 2015** |
|• SCHP: Investigator Cpl. Michael E. Duncan speaks with Cpl. David Rowell about the man at Bi-Lo who Sandy mentioned.|
|• Rowell apparently did not record this interview, like all of the other interviews
|• He noted that the man at Bi-Lo said *“him and Stephen had a relationship for a while but has not seen him in a while.”* |
|• Duncan noted *“there is no video from the store,”* but didn’t say what he was looking for on video.
|• This is the last mention of the man from Bi-Lo in the investigation files.|
| **July 28, 2015** |
|• SCHP: Duncan notes he is reviewing iPad download.|
| **July 29, 2015** |
|SLED: Letter to J.D. James of SCHP from forensic scintist Michael Moskal of SLED regarding trace evidence results:|
|• One black Nike short sleeve shirt: No automotive paint found|
|• One pair of khaki Unionbay cargo shorts: No automotive paint found|
|• Cutting taken from item 3: No automotive paint found|
|• One pair of blue Airspeed Footwear shoes: No automotive paint found|
|• Debris collected from items 2-4: *“Several single-layer metallic blue paint chips were found. Due to the condition of the sample, no make, model and year information was able to be obtained. These paint chips are suitable for comparison should a standard become available.”* the note says.|
|• SCHP: Duncan contacts Johnson. Arranges to pick up the iPhone “on Tuesday”
|• SCHP: Duncan contacts Sandy Smith to get help unlocking the phone. Sandy tells him she was the secondary fingerprint. She tells him she can meet with him Tuesday in Orangeburg
|•SCHP: James receives a message to call Moskal in reference to discussing trace evidence located on the deceased clothes in this case. Moskal tells him that he found around 10 1mm single-layer blue paint chips and advised that he needed more paint layer evidence to pinpoint a particular vehicle. Moskal tells James that the PDQ database tells him that the paint could be from an industrial tool, dumpster or sign post. Moskal notes that Toyota used this paint on its vehicles from 1982-1988.|
|• *Editor’s Note on the paint chips: 1mm is very small — the width of a pencil tip. And keep in mind, chain of custody appeared to be broken on the clothes when they were left alone at the funeral home in a bag. So it’s hard to say where those paint chips came from* |
| **August 4, 2015** |
|SCHP: Duncan picks up iPhone from SLED. Notes: *“No chain of custody with the phone”* |
| *Note: this is odd, because in another SLED report it says that Duncan signed a chain of custody form on August 4 and  and transferred the phone with J. Conelly of the SCHP on I-95 on August 5.*  |
|SCHP: Meets with Sandy Smith and Stephen’s relative in Orangeburg. *“Unable to unlock the phone.”* |
|SCHP: Duncan contacts one of Stephen’s friends.|
|•  Said she talked to him around 7 or 8 p.m. the night he died|
|• Just talking about school. He didn’t say where he was at or what he was doing|
|• *“He was very likeable. Not to my knowledge did anyone not like him.”* |
|• *“I heard it was a hit and run and that it wasn’t.”* |
|• She didn’t hear of any other rumors as to what happened|
| **Aug. 5, 2015** |
|8:30 a.m. SCHP: Duncan meets with Lance Cpl. Conley and is given the iPad|
|9:42 a.m. SCHP: Duncan interviews Cpl. David Rowell|
|SCHP put a billboard up on Sandy Run Road asking for tips in Stephen Smith’s case.|
| *“We haven’t really found anything that would indicate to us that it’s vehicle involved,”* Rowell said|
|SCHP: Duncan notes he returned iPad to Stephen’s sister.|
| **August 7, 2015** |
|11:15 a.m. SCHP: Duncan calls Stephen’s friend — who we will call “Britney.”|
|Duncan says Stephen’s relative called him to say that she saw Britney at church and Britney had information about Stephen’s death. Duncan asked her to email him this information.|
|• Britney tells him that *“another friend of mine”* had texted her and asked her *“Were Buster and Stephen together?”* |
|• She told the friend *“No. Not that I knew of. Why?”* |
|• He responded that he had heard it.|
|• She asked the friend from whom and he said he didn’t know, just that he’d heard it.|
|• Duncan responds, *“OK so he didn’t have anything to base that upon except for more or less a rumor, is that correct?”* |
|• Duncan asks Britney whether she had ever heard of Stephen and Buster being together before this.
|• She says she had not.|
|• Duncan asks to make sure that this was the first she had heard the rumor and Britney says yes|
|• Duncan asks Britney whether she knew Stephen was gay. She says *“I did”*|
|• Duncan asks her whether she had heard any rumors about Stephen’s death that she *“just knew wasn’t true other than what we’ve been talking about.”* She says no. *“That’s the only thing that I heard”*
|• Duncan asks her if anything curious happened at his funeral or afterward that stuck out as unusual to her. She says not that she’s aware of.|
|• She says a boy named (we will called him “Jack“) told her about the rumor, and then|
|DUNCAN’S NOTES: *“Contacted (“Britney”) in reference to Stephen Smith death…. States a boy named (” Jack”) ask if Stephen and Buster Murdaugh ever had any type of relationship.”* |
|SCHP: Duncan calls Jack and leaves a message|
| **August 10, 2015** |
|SCHP: Duncan notes Jack’s father has called him and wants to know what is going on. Says Jack will call him later.|
| **Aug. 11, 2015** |
|10:35 a.m. SCHP: Jack calls Duncan.|
|Duncan tells Jack that he knows he sent a text to Britney.|
|Jack knows Stephen (he confirms)|
|Duncan asked if Buster Murdaugh had any relationship with Stephen. Said he had heard it. |
|Jack said *“I’ve heard the rumor.”* |
| Do you know any info if that’s true or not? “Not at all. |
|When asked if he knows anything about about Stephen’s death, Jack says *“No sir, not at all.”* |
|Jack said that’s the only rumor he’s heard in relation to Stephen’s death.|
|Editor’s note: While doing a basic background search on Jack, we noticed that he was facing two different lawsuits from the Murdaugh’s law firm. Attorney John E. Parker — a powerful, well-known firm partner — filed two car accident lawsuits against Jack in late July 2015. They were both dismissed in 2016.|
|SCHP: Duncan notes that he continues to look through information downloaded from Smith’s iPad. *“Still trying to get a timeline. No new information.”* The iPad *“was at Orangeburg Tech the night before his death according to breadcrumbs file.”* |
|SCHP: According to the chain of custody report, investigator Todd Proctor transferred the rape kit to another person (see below) at a location that says *“TR 6a”* on August 11 ,2015.|

|SCHP: Duncan calls Mike. It goes straight to voicemail. Leaves message|
|SCHP: Duncan speaks to Sandy Smith. She gives him the phone number of *“a person that may know some information.”* |
|SCHP: Duncan calls “Ben”. Leaves message|
|SCHP: Duncan calls a woman because Sandy Smith said she might have information about Smith’s death. Phone rings four times. No voicemail. He never calls back|
|SCHP: Stephen’s relative told Duncan that a man told her there was a green Jeep following Stephen on the he died or the day before. There is no note of Duncan ever trying to contact this man.|
| **August 27, 2015** |
|12:42 p.m. SCHP: Duncan interviews a man — “Ben” — over the phone. Sandy Smith told Duncan the previous day that he had information on Stephen’s death.|
|Ben worked at Hardee’s in Hampton|
|He went to school with Stephen, but never hung out with him outside of school|
|He said a white man in his 30s and 40s came looking for him and Ben called the police and told them about it. And then his coworker said he was looking for him again. He said he knew Ben from hanging out with Stephen and him before.|
|When asked if he’s heard any rumors about Stephen’s death, he said he heard that *“he was running in the woods from somebody.”* |
|He then said he thought he was running from an older guy. (*“Maybe it was some guy he was messing with and nobody knew and Stephen was going to bring him out”*).|
| **August 28, 2015** |
|SCHP: Lance Cpl. Conley interviews a man — who we will call Joe — on Hilton Head after Sandy Smith found a day pass for a Hilton Head gated community with Joe’s name on it.|
|Joe was older and recently divorced.|
|He met Stephen online, but said *“no money exchanged.”* |
|Joe said he doesn’t do “this kind of thing very often.|
|He said they hooked up on June 28, but it was a one-night stand.|
|Joe said he texted him a few times after that and didn’t realize he passed away until he was contacted by Sandy.|
|Editor’s note: This is the last time SCHP contacted Joe in the investigation. They never asked this man his whereabouts on the July 8.|
| **September 1, 2015** |
|5:02 p.m. SCHP: Proctor interviews a man — we’ll call him “Kevin” — on the phone.|
|Proctor mentions a *“he-said, she-said”* rumor and asks for a rundown.|
|Kevin says he heard this past weekend that *“certain young men”* were riding down 601, saw Stephen broken down on the road, passed Stephen and turned around and *“stuck something out the window,”* that ended up hitting Stephen.|
|He tells Proctor *“I want to help you in anyway possible.”* |
|He said he’s heard three names.|
| *“I don’t want to say it over the phone,”* he said about the names he’s been told|
|Kevin asks to meet in person, saying he’s willing to help with anything|
|Kevin says that he’s sort of *“torn”* because he hates going by the *“he-said, she-said”* situation, but that when he thinks about the situation, it *“would make sense.”* He says it would be worth looking into|
|Proctor says he understands Kevin’s reservations about saying the name.|
|Proctor tells him his office is out of Charleston and *“there’s no big name in Hampton that worries me and I want you to feel at ease about this as well.”* |
|Proctor says that he heard *“that people associated with this name”* have been around *“kind of not, well, kind of threatening, putting the heat on people”* to keep their mouths shut.|
|Kevin says he knew *“this person”* and went to school with him and says *“it kind of all makes sense,”* and that he hates being the kind of person to throw accusations out there.|
|Kevin tells him he understands what he’s saying about being from Charleston but he’d feel more comfortable talking to Proctor in person.|
|They make arrangements to meet in the morning.|
| **September 2, 2015** |
|SLED: The crime scene investigation summary from James B. Tallon III is issued.|
|SLED mailed crime scene photos to Inv. Perry Singleton of HCSO and Coroner Ernie Washington.|
|9:21 a.m. SCHP: Proctor meets up with Kevin.|
|• Kevin says he first heard Stephen was shot but then heard it was a hit and run.|
|• He says recently, in the past week, week and a half, he heard that two or three people were riding around 601 and saw Stephen on the side of the road and were messing around with him, *“stuck something out the window”* |
|•Kevin says he heard it was Buster Murdaugh. *“Kind of out of character to who I knew.”* |
|• He says the person who told him this, though, said that Buster was on drugs|
|• Kevin says *“I hate to only be able to give you hearsay. I hate it because the main thing is whether that is the case or not the case, there is still somebody who lost a child, lost a brother, lost a family member and that’s just not right.”* |
|• Proctor asks him who Kevin heard this from. *“A fellow named (Jack’s real name).”* |
|• Kevin says that Jack told him that Buster and (a man who we will call “Trevor”) tried to sell him cocaine at a party at Moselle|
|• Kevin says that Trevor just moved to Oklahoma, which he says is weird.|
|• *“It’s just weird to me,”* Kevin says. *“All this, it could be a very strange coincidence but it’s just weird to me”* |
|• Trevor was *“bad on drugs,”* according to Kevin.|
|• Proctor asks Kevin whether he thinks Trevor was in the car. Kevin says it *“fits the mold”* |
|• *“There’s some part inside me that says there’s a possibility,”* he says of Kevin being in the car.|
|• Proctor asks about Trevor moving. Kevin says he found this out through Facebook.|
|• Kevin gives Proctor the run-down of where he got the heard the rumor from.|
|• Kevin says doesn’t understand why law enforcement hasn’t gone straight to (name of guy who appears to be source of the rumor).|
|• Proctor says he heard that Buster and the guys were coming back from a baseball game.|
|• Kevin says Buster and whoever was with him were coming from the Murdaughs’ house in Moselle on 601.|
|Proctor asks whether Kevin knows if Buster was driving.|
|• *“I would imagine so,”* Kevin says, adding that Kevin usually was the one to drive when his friends were driving around.|
|• Kevin says Buster used to drive a Suburban, but would sometimes drive a black F-150 or an F-250.|
|• Kevin says he has no idea who else was in the car.|
| **On the Murdaughs** |
|• He says the only name given to him was the Murdaugh name and he said everyone is *“shy”* to say anything because of *“I don’t want to say power but the name brings a certain standard with it.”* |
|• *”I think that’s why people are hush hush about it,”* Kevin says.|
|• Proctor says he’s heard that “they have gone to certain people” and told them to keep their mouths closed. Kevin says three people were at a party talking about Stephen’s death and another guy said *“I feel nothing with come of it”* and that’s how the Murdaugh name got brought up|
• *“I feel like they wouldn’t want anything to happen to their reputation,”* Kevin said.|
|• Kevin has even gone to South Carolina football games with them.|
|• *“I hate to throw names out there but then again what’s right is right, what’s wrong is wrong,”* Kevin says.|
|• Proctor: *“I think it’s a situation when you grow up and your family is kinda high profile and you get away with  some things because of your family name and you’re given, given, and given things. You become invincible in a way and you get a little liquor and you think you’re untouchable.”* |
|• *“I think that it happened, they freaked out and maybe it’s just trying to get covered up at this point”* |
|• Kevin says they Smiths *“deserve the truth.”* *“I’d want to know the truth”* |
|• Proctor says *“Buster was on our radar long before you were… the Murdaughs know that. They know he’s on our radar. What you’re telling me is valuable information.”* |
|• Proctor then tells Kevin a separate chain of people who told SCHP about the Murdaugh’s involvement.|
| **On Moselle** |
|• Kevin tells Proctor about how the Murdaughs have *“big parties”* at their houses *“every weekend”* or *“every other weekend,”* including kids from Varnville and Bamberg, *“anywhere you could think of.”* |
|• *“That is where the party spot was in Hampton,”* Kevin says of Moselle.
Kevin says he’s gone to one party there|
|• He says it’s known for *“a lot of fights, alcohol drugs kind of thrown in there at the same time.”* |
| **On Paul** |
|• Kevin says when he originally heard Stephen’s death, he thought it was Paul they were talking about because he’s more the *“I don’t want to say troublemaker. He’s more the ‘my last name is Murdaugh, I can do whatever.’”* |
|• Proctor asks about Paul. *“Is he 15, 16?”* Kevin says Paul is either a junior, possibly a senior, in high school|
|• Paul used to be called *“Little Paul.”* |
|• Kevin says he was hesitant to give the names out. *“I’m not scared of those people but I definitely don’t want them knowing that I had anything to do with this. I just don’t want to get into all that because Hampton is a small town”* |
|• *“I really can’t say anything bad about them,” Kevin says. *“They were nothing but nice. I hate it that I have to say anything towards them. I can’t help if it’s the truth. You name can’t carry you but so far.”* |
| **Accident or Murder?** |
|• Proctor says the way he understands it is that they didn’t go out there to intentionally kill Stephen
| *“I feel very strongly about that”* Kevin says when asked whether he thinks it’s an accident. He says he doesn’t believe Stephen was killed on purpose|
|• Proctor: *“And that’s the thing. That night. If they were playing around ….”* (once you start hiding it and lying it makes it worse … *“How do you expect me to take mercy on you when you left this family for months not knowing what happened to their loved one”*)|
|• Proctor says *“Typically you don’t see the Highway Patrol working a murder and that’s what this is. We’re not classifying this as anything other than a murder.”* |
|• Proctor: *“There’s a reason why Hampton County Sheriff’s Office is not handling this and I’ll leave it at that”* |
| **On the rumor** |
|• Kevin says someone at work told him that Highway Patrol was looking for *“the Murdaugh kid.”* |
|• Proctor: *“I’m not saying the Murdaugh boy did it because I don’t know yet but if we’re going to start throwing out names I’m not going to withhold his name because of who he is. His name’s going to be out there just like anybody else’s name that is on my radar and I don’t care who knows it”* |
|• Kevin says he hopes Murdaugh didn’t do it. *“But when you start throwing puzzle pieces in there … it makes more sense than not”* |
|• Proctor says *“there had to be more than one”* (person involved)|
|• Proctor says if Buster was the one driving then someone else was responsible for hitting Stephen. *“It’s not all on Buster Murdaugh. There’s more people involved here.”* |

| **[Stephen Smith Case Files Part 3: Murdaugh Rumors Fly During 2015 Investigation](https://www.fitsnews.com/2021/09/03/stephen-smith-case-files-part-3-murdaugh-rumors-in-the-investigation/)** |
|The Murdaugh name came up more than 40 times in the investigation….|
|It’s been more than two months since the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) opened its investigation into the death of Stephen Smith *“based on information gathered during the course of the double murder investigation of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh.”* |
|In the weeks following that announcement, Stephen Smith‘s case caught the attention of reporters across the country. National media parachuted into Hampton to try to interview Stephen’s mother Sandy Smith. *“The media just wants a story,”* Sandy Smith told FITSNews, referring to invasive national news outlets. *“I just want justice.”*|
|SLED has not updated the public on their investigation into Stephen Smith’s death. While we wait for SLED to release more information on the investigation, FITSNews has taken a deep dive into the 2015 investigation files. Like the probe of the 2019 boat crash that killed Mallory Beach, the 2015 investigation into Smith’s death was chaotic from the beginning — derailed by jurisdictional obscurity and suspicions of investigative interference.|
|Before SLED opened its case, the South Carolina Highway Patrol (SCHP) was the agency assigned to investigate Stephen’s death.|
| **Evidence from the scene** |
|• Smith was found dead just before 4:00 a.m. on July 8, 2015 in the middle of Sandy Run Road in Hampton County, South Carolina. |
|• No tire marks or no debris from a vehicle found on scene after several searches.|
|• Stephen’s loosely tied shoes were on his feet when he was found dead in the middle of the road.|
|• His car was found three miles away on Bamberg Highway with the gas cap off|
|• Chain of custody apparently was broken when Stephen’s clothes were left unattended at the funeral home.|
|• Stephen’s head was bruised and misshapen by blunt force. His shoulder was partially dislocated, and had no other major injuries.|
| **Dispute about the hit-and-run theory** |
| Investigators on scene July 8, 2015 went back and forth between a gunshot homicide and hit and run accident|
|• South Carolina Highway Patrol (SCHP) officers were told it wasn’t a vehicular accident they didn’t have to be at the autopsy|
|• At the autopsy, MUSC pathologist Dr. Erin Presnell ruled that Stephen was killed in a hit-and-run crash.|
|• Two SCHP investigators who spoke with Presnell described hostile experiences with the pathologist and couldn’t get a direct answer for why she ruled Stephen’s death a vehicle accident.|
|• The coroner said he didn’t believe Stephen’s death was a hit and run.|
|• The case was given to SCHP (until 2021, when SLED opened an investigation)|
| **September 2, 2015** |
|SCHP: After investigator Todd Proctor ended his interview with ‘Kevin,’ he calls ‘Jack.’ Jack was facing two separate lawsuits from the Murdaugh law firm at the time of this interview. Jack was previously interviewed in August 2015. He is the only person to be interviewed twice in this investigation.|
|• Proctor: *I met with (Kevin) this morning, I’m sure you’re aware, he kinda told me his side of it, and I gotta keep working this rumor backwards if its rumors or truth whatever it may be. Tell me the version of the story you heard.* |
|• Jack: *I was with friends one night and out of the blue with my friend (“Monica”) said that — we already knew he got hit or whatever but we didn’t know who did it. We just heard Buster did it. Everybody knows who Buster is and his family and all that.. and it was kinda shocking and all that. And I guess we kept talking about it and spreading it around.* |
|• Jack: *(Monica) told me this. She’s my classmate. She was like ‘you won’t believe who did it. And she said his name and I was like really?’ She heard it from ‘Kayla,” whose father works in law enforcement.* |
|• Proctor: *The story I got is that Buster and one or two other people were driving around and saw Stephen’s car. Loooped around. Saw him in the road. Struck something outside of the vehicle and it hit him. Is that the story you heard?* |
|• Jack: *Yes.* |
|• Proctor: *Like I told (Kevin) this morning, Buster Murdaugh was on our radar long before we ever got this information I’m calling you about now. It’s not like somebody is going to say (Kevin) or (Jack) are the ones that put it on Buster. My office is out of Charleston. I don’t work around Hampton. I know the Murdaughs are high falooting and some people say have a lot of power. That name doesn’t mean anything to me. My job is to find out… you don’t have to agree with Stephen’s lifestyle, but that don’t mean he gets to be killed and nobody gets to find out that happened.* |
|• Jack: *He was a cool person, honestly. We were all in class with him. It was shocking.* |
|• Proctor: *He didn’t get hit by no car. I’m not saying someone murdered him. But if it was somebody playing around and it got out of control, the problem is when you lie and cover it up. You know Stephen’s story deserves to be told. If you want to call (Monica) and give her a head’s up* |
| Proctor calls Monica. She doesn’t answer.|
|1:15 p.m. SCHOP: Proctor calls Kayla.|
|• When asked what she heard about the Stephen Smith’s death, she said she heard *“one of my classmates did it.”* |
|• Proctor: *Who is that?* |
|• Kayla: *Buster Murdaugh.* |
|• Proctor: *I’ll be honest with you, Buster Murdaugh has been on our radar long before this.* |
|• Proctor then asks if she heard this rumor from her father who is in law enforcement.|
|• Kayla: *No sir.* |
|• Proctor: *“I’ve talked with quite a few people down there and you have less to worry about since your daddy is a (law enforcement officer). A lot of people seem nervous to say the name Murdaugh. I understand they’re pretty big down in Hampton but I’m in Charleston and that name doesn’t mean anything to me so I want you to understand that.* |
|• Kayla said she heard the rumor from another guy “Issac”|
|• Kayla tells him she doesn’t know how Isaac knows about this, but he said that they beat Stephen up and threw him out of a truck.|
|• Kayla tells Proctor that she didn’t know of any enemies.|
|• Proctor: *Everybody knew Stephen’s lifestyle, but nobody really had issue with it. It doesn’t sound like Buster had issues with him. It doesn’t make sense.”* |
|• Proctor:  *Regardless if you liked Stephen or agreed to his lifestyle, somebody killed him. His story deserves to be told. That’s what I’m trying to get to the bottom of.* |
|• Proctor then asked Kayla about l.|
|• Proctor: *“You’re the 9th person I’ve talked to about this, so hopefully people start talking.* |
|• Kayla then gave him “Mia’s” number.|
|He tells her that he was down in Hampton yesterday. *“I tried to stir up some dust yesterday and get some people talking … hopefully some people are going to start talking”* |
|• Interview ends at 2:22 p.m|
|4:15 p.m. SCHP: Proctor Calls Mia|
|The beginning of the interview is hard to hear. It sounds like she heard of another rumor involving a man stalking another man at a fast food restaurant. Proctor does not ask follow up questions about this rumor.|
|Proctor: *The information that was first given to me was that Buster Murdaugh and one or two other people out that night and saw Stephen’s car and they went down a road and saw him walking and held something  or swung something out of a car and accidentally hit him. Does any of that sound familiar?*
Mia:  *I’ve heard something about Buster but I didn’t remember..*|
|Proctor: *“I’m out of Charleston. I’m not from Hampton. But I know the Murdaugh name in Hampton is pretty big. But as far as I’m concerned  I couldn’t give two craps about the Murdaughs. But what I’m seeing is a lot of people seem hesitant to talk to the Murdaughs or Buster. Do you kinda see that?”* |
|Mia: *When we were speaking about it, someone told me it was Buster. They were saying nothing would be done about it because who he was.* |
|Proctor: *But that’s the problem. I don’t care about Buster. I’m not a local police officer in Hampton.I don’t care about the last name Murdaugh. I’m not saying I’m going to put it on Buster. But if he did something do with it, it needs to come out. The thing about it is…. We all know Stephen lived a different lifestyle. But it seems to me like no one really took issue to that. He seemed like the kind of guy everyone got along with him.  It seemed like no one really had issues with him.* |
|Mia agrees.|
|Proctor: *Someone had a part to play in his death. He wasn’t hit by a car. Something else happened. The unfortunate part is…My job is to tell Stephen’s story because he can’t.* |
|Proctor: *The Murdaughs, as big and powerful and whatever and rich as everyone thinks they are. They’re going to go on living their lives like nothing (happened). So they can play that card like they care about everyone else. No they don’t…. They care about protecting themselves.* |
|Proctor: *If Buster had something to do with it. I’d like to be able to prove that. But the information that I’m getting it’s kinda..  It started out strong because I had an individual who really stepped out against the Murdaughs and was willing to talk and it seems as I keep continuing on and talking to other people it’s getting watered down a good bit.* |
|Proctor then asks if Mia has Isaac’s number and she gives it to him.|
|Proctor: *I’d like to get in touch with (Issac) of where he got this information how Buster was involved. I’ve talked to several different people and I’ve encouraged people not to hide anything. If you’re friends with Isaac, let him know that I’m going to be in touch with him. None of y’all are in any kind of trouble. I need someone to give me solid information aside from what the Murdaughs are saying.* |
|Proctor: *I’m trying to track down, you are now the 10th person I’ve talked to in reference to this one rumor. It had to start somewhere. If you say you heard it from (Isaac), eventually I’m going to get to the source. I was in Hampton yesterday and stirred up some dust. If you hear anything if you have my number, please give me a call.* |
|There is no record of Proctor ever calling Issac. According to the investigation file, the Highway Patrol didn’t touch the case between September 2, 2015 and late October.|
| **October 20, 2015** |
|SCHP: Proctor calls Buster Murdaugh. Note says *“didn’t answer, voicemail full.”* Proctor then emails him. There is no audio recording of this phone call, like when he called Monica. This is the only time in the investigation Highway Patrol attempted to talk to Buster.|
| **November 17, 2015** |
|12:23 p.m. SCHP: Sandy Smith calls Duncan wanting to know if any of the interviews have led to new information. There are no other notes about this phone call.|
|  **November, 18, 2015** |
|SCHP: Sandy Smith calls and tells Duncan that she heard on the radio that an arrest had been or will be made in her son’s death.|
| **November, 19, 2015** |
|SCHP: Proctor contacts the radio station to find out *“if this was true and maybe who called saying it”* |
|3:30 p.m. SCHP: Proctor interviews a host from the radio station|
|Host: *“Stephen Smith doesn’t ring a bell to me.. I’m trying to think. I’m on the talk show, so I’m just trying to think”* when Proctor asks Gooding about someone calling in on the case saying their way a rest. |
|Host: *Oh that little fellow that they called it a hit and run and someone said he was out of gas? Someone called in yesterday and asked if there was an arrest in the case and said they were investigating a prominent family or something like that.”* |
|Host: *I know it was a white male. I’d be lying if I knew who called.* |
|The radio host said people call in all the time and talk about arrests and rumors. |
|Proctor asks him about rumors.|
|Host: *“I don’t know if it’s true or not, somebody told me… a good friend of mine’s son… the Murdaugh kid down in Hampton” and that was yesterday. You gotta understand… that’s Hampton and that’s just a rumor…. Street committee.* |
|Host: *“I heard yesterday, like I say street talk, someone said … there are a thousand rumors flying about this. Like I said, it’s a prominent family Hampton County and I’m sure people don’t like them. I mean they’re friends of mine, but I’m sure people don’t like them and will take any shot they can at them.* |
|The host asks if the MAIT team is investigating the case.|
|Proctor: Nobody has been arrested at this point. |
| **November 24, 2015** |
|Hampton County Guardian: Story by Matt Popovich called *“Mother of slain HC states possible ‘hate’ crime”* about Stephen’s death is published.|
|Sandy Smith told the Guardian she heard *“rumors about an older man stalking him,”* but she’s heard other rumors she *“believes more.”* *“She reiterated, several times, her opinion that her son was killed, for being gay, by several local Hampton County youths from prestigious families which she believes have sworn to protect their children, no matter what heinous crime they committed,”* Popovich wrote.|
|Sandy would not give the reporter names, but said she believed that Stephen would not have been walking on Sandy Run Road in the middle of the night. She didn’t buy the hit-and-run theory at all. She said boys, some of whom were Stephen’s classmates, were coming home from a baseball game and *“they took him from his car.”* |
| *“I hear the same story but from different people. Everybody knows what happened to my son, but nobody wants to tell me who is responsible,”* she said.|
|SCHP: Duncan receives an anonymous tip: *“Dontereo Aiken along with another black male and a white male (Murdaugh) are the ones involved in death”* |
|SCHP: Duncan contacts Rowell and briefs him on the tip. Duncan sends an email to three other SCHP troopers (not Todd Proctor) *“about what I wanted L/CPL Rowell to do”* |
|SCHP: Duncan sends information to Proctor *“and advised him about situation”* |
| **December 18, 2015** |
|SCHP: Proctor receives information from Duncan about Darrell Williams, who says his stepson Patrick Wilson told him that Shawn Connelly *“struck and killed Stephen Smith.”* Proctor notes:|
|Williams said his stepson told him this in confidence. He said Wilson had moved out and he did not know where he was staying. Williams said he could only tell Proctor that Wilson attended some Christian school in Ridgeland.|
|Proctor drives to Ridgeland and goes to the Step of Faith School, but Wilson does not go there|
|Proctor then goes to Legacy Euhaw Baptist Church School. Wilson is a student but not at school that day|
|Williams doesn’t return Proctors calls seeking more information|
| *“Mr. Williams stated that the reason that he was passing this information on was because Randy Murdaugh told him to call,”* Proctor wrote in his report.|
|This conversation was not recorded.|
| **December 21, 2015** |
|3:25 p.m. SCHP: Duncan interviews Nick Ginn of the Hampton Police Department in reference to *“a tip that came in from an email from Sgt. Burns”*|
|Duncan says he’s calling Ginn at a phone number, which Duncan says is the Hampton Police Department|
|When FITSNews looked up the phone number written in the report and stated in the recording, the number is for a local law firm (not the Murdaugh law firm). The Hampton Police Department is a completely different phone number.|
|When Ginn picks up the phone he says *“Sgt. Ginn”* as if picking up the phone in his own office|
|When Duncan asks Ginn whether he has time to talk about the Hampton Co. case, Ginn tells him he’s at somebody else’s desk and needs to put him on hold to get a piece of paper *“in case”* he needs to *“take notes”* |
|Ginn returns after some delay. *“Some of our phones have ‘line 1,’ some of them don’t”* |
|Darrell is Ginn’s stepdad|
|What was told to Ginn from Darrell: Patrick Wilson said Shawn Connelly was drunk and hit something.| 
|He came back the next day and said saw cops and learned through the media somebody had been killed. He said Shawn called Patrick crying. Shawn called Patrick crying saying that’s what happened
Patrick cried as he told his stepfather the story and walked outside and threw up, Ginn said. They wondered if Patrick was with him.|
|Duncan: *Did he describe what happened?* |
|Ginn: *Supposedly It was the mirror, I sent Nick the pictures of the truck he was driving that night. I want to say I sent everything to Mitch Altman (of SCHP). Him and my brother and me are good friends and I didn’t know who to contact. Mitch said he would get that information to the right person.* |
|Darrell told Ginn he was concerned and somebody lost a son.|
|Duncan says they got this tip on Dec. 9, 2015, and *“we got a couple people out looking for Patrick”*|
|Duncan asks him whether he had heard about this incident before. Ginn says he heard some rumors around town but *“as far as anything that I could say would have any kind of possible validity would be this* |
|Duncan: *What do you feel about Patrick?* |
|Ginn says he thinks he’s a *“good-hearted person”* but he’s *“shady”* |
|Duncan: *Does Patrick have a criminal record?* |
|Ginn: *I think he was charged with attempted murder, but I’m not exactly sure what the circumstances behind that was. But I think it was one of those things they charged with a higher charge to work their way down*  |
|According to the investigation file, the Highway Patrol never contacted Patrick Wilson or Shawn Connelly.|
| **The Patrick Wilson Case** |
|The following information was discovered by FITSNews in its investigation of the Stephen Smith case.|
|The Highway Patrol did not appear to look into Wilson’s charges at all.|
|Wilson was charged with first-degree assault and battery and attempted murder on April 17, 2015.|
|According to the arrest warrants in the case, Wilson got into an argument with a man and fired a shot at the man’s car that had two passengers inside.|
|Wilson was charged with first-degree assault and battery and attempted murder on April 17, 2015.|
|According to the arrest warrants in the case, Wilson got into an argument with a man and fired a shot at the man’s car that had two passengers inside.|
|The incident happened on Prince William Road in Brunson, South Carolina.|
| *“All victims were afraid for their lives,”* the arrest warrants say.|
|Shawn Connelly — the person who Wilson claimed hit Stephen with his truck — was in the car with Wilson when the shooting occurred, according to his witness statement. Connelly told police that Patrick Wilson grabbed his gun and shot at the sign after he argued with a man.|
|The Hampton County Grand Jury indicted Wilson on attempted murder and assault and battery in August 2015.|
|While Wilson was out on bond, the family he allegedly shot at filed several harassment complaints about Wilson.|
|Cory Fleming — a close friend of the Murdaugh family — represented Patrick Wilson in the case. In 2018, Fleming represented Gloria Satterfield‘s family in a wrongful death settlement against Alex Murdaugh. In 2019, Fleming temporarily represented Connor Cook in the boat crash that killed Mallory Beach.|
|In February 2018, Wilson’s indictment was nolle prossed — which means the 14th circuit solicitor’s office (where Alex Murdaugh worked as a part-time solicitor) decided to not prosecute and the charges were dropped.|
| **November 3, 2021** |
| **[Sandy Smith Says She Was Blindsided By Her Attorney’s Media Comments About Her Son’s Death](https://www.fitsnews.com/2021/11/03/sandy-smith-says-she-was-blindsided-by-her-attorneys-tv-interview-about-her-sons-death/)** |
| *“All I’ve ever wanted was the truth.”* |
|Sandy Smith told FITSNews she was not advised by her attorney Andy Savage before he made a bombshell claim in the media that the potential Murdaugh connections to Stephen Smith’s 2015 death *“may be unfounded.”*|
|The grieving mother — who hasn’t stopped fighting for justice in her son’s unsolved death — said her attorney’s interview felt like yet another slap in the face. Only this time, it came from her own attorney — who was supposed to be on her side.|
| *“It was very heartbreaking to have to read something like that in the media,”* Sandy told FITSNews.|
|Smith is now questioning Savage’s intentions in representing her after the comments were published on ABC News 4 last Wednesday. She said that Savage’s private investigator Steven Peterson told her two weeks ago he believed they had a suspect in the case and he didn’t think the Murdaughs were connected, but he said he didn’t want to say anything until he knew for sure.|
| *“I thought that they would wait until they knew for certain before putting it all over the news,”* Smith said. Sandy Smith was clear — she wasn’t mad about the conclusion that Savage and Peterson reached in the investigation to apparently absolve the Murdaughs (well, Savage specifically stated that his comments were about Paul Murdaugh, but didn’t add much clarity).|
| *“All I’ve ever wanted was the truth,”* Sandy said. *“I don’t care who did it. I just want to know who killed my son.”* Sandy also is wondering why Savage chose last week — just days before Dateline and 48 Hours premiered their investigations on the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ true crime saga— to reveal his investigation findings to media.|
|In the article, reporter Drew Tripp of WCIV TV 4 (ABC – Charleston, S.C.) wrote that Savage *“made the revelations Wednesday as his reason for denying a request by ABC News 4’s Anne Emerson to interview Stephen Smith’s mother, Sandy Smith.”* Sandy told FITSNews she was not aware of that request, however.|
|Sandy told FITSNews that Savage has been very strict about her media appearances and has threatened to drop her as a client if she took interviews without asking him first. Multiple attorneys told FITSNews this is a typical practice, however, it is not typical — and possibly unethical — to speak to the media on your client’s behalf without consulting them first.|
|According to Sandy, Savage agreed to represent her in June after the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) opened an investigation into Stephen’s death. SLED officials said they opened the investigation based on information gathered during the course of the double homicide investigation of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh.|
|Just days before SLED officials made the announcement, a SLED agent asked to interview Sandy in connection to the double homicide of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh. She was devastated to hear the news that she and her family were being viewed as possible persons of interest in the savage slayings — when at the time, SLED hadn’t taken any time to investigate Stephen’s case.|
|  *“What a slap in the face,”* she told FITSNews back in June.
Now, almost five months after SLED opened the investigation into her son’s 2015 death, Sandy is feeling the devastation all over again — while still no arrests have been made in Stephen’s case. *“There’s always another slap in the face on the other cheek, I guess,”* Sandy said.|
|Savage is one of the most notable attorneys in South Carolina. He recently represented some of the Charleston shooting victims who were recently awarded an $88 million settlement with the Department of Justice. In one of his most recent cases, his client Michael Slager, a police officer who shot a black man, claimed he was a grossly incompetent attorney for not informing him of a plea deal that would have reduced his sentence, the Associated Press reported.|
|Considering Savage’s extensive background in law, several questions should be raised about his recent comments: As his client’s official spokesperson, why would answer media questions — and drop a bombshell — that his client didn’t know about? How could his comments have possibly benefited his client, Sandy Smith?|
| *“I thought there was such thing as privileged information that I should know before everybody else,”* she said. *“I didn’t even get the chance to warn my children that this was coming out. It’s very disheartening. It’s very wrong.”* Sandy told FITSNews that she is prepared to go at this fight alone now that someone else broke her trust. *“I’m going to try to take care of this myself because I don’t know who to trust now,”* Sandy told FITSNews.|
|Savage told FITSNews late Wednesday (after the story published) that he provided a written statement that said *“the media seems focused (perhaps obsessed) on a Murdaugh link to the Smith case.”* |
 *“Our investigation has not eliminated other possibilities,”* Savage said. *“I believe that the SLED investigation continues to explore all possibilities. Good for them.”* |
|Like the probe of the 2019 boat crash that killed Mallory Beach, the 2015 investigation into Smith’s death was chaotic from the beginning — clouded by jurisdictional confusion and suspicions of investigative interference.|
|Smith was found dead just before 4:00 a.m. EDT on July 8, 2015. Crime scene photos obtained by FITSNews are horrific — Stephen’s entire face was covered in blood that cascaded from a 7.25-inch gaping hole on the right side of his forehead. His head was misshapen by blunt force.|
|Stephen’s massive head wound — along with the lack of other significant injuries on his body — stumped investigators on scene. His right shoulder was partially dislocated. Cuts and bruises dotted his right hand. His loosely tied shoes were still on and his clothes appeared untouched. His phone and keys were still in his pocket.|
|Investigators found Smith’s car three miles away on the side of Bamberg Highway. His wallet was inside the car. SCHP detectives noted the car’s gas cap was unscrewed and hanging outside of the gas cap door. Law enforcement officers believed Smith ran out of gas and started walking home before he was killed.|
|Officials couldn’t nail down a cause or manner of death. At first, they thought it was a hit and run. Then, the coroner ruled the death a shooting homicide — forcing investigators to search the rural road carved between a tree line and a corn field.|
|In their search, investigators from SCHP, the Hampton County sheriff’s office, and SLED found virtually no evidence — no bullets, no gunshot residue, no tire marks, no debris from a vehicle.|
|Hours later, a pathologist at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) — Dr. Erin Presnell — ruled that Stephen was killed in a hit-and-run accident, a decision which was met with confusion and skepticism by investigators and those who knew Stephen.  |
|Throughout the course of the investigation, SCHP troopers specializing in vehicular accident investigations rejected the claim that Stephen was killed in a hit-and-run accident. The SCHP was assigned to lead the case — which appeared to skew the investigation off course from the get-go.|
|The Murdaugh name was mentioned over 40 times throughout the course of the investigation. More than half of the people interviewed during the investigation told police they heard Buster Murdaugh was possibly involved in Stephen’s death.|
|However, Buster Murdaugh was never interviewed by SCHP investigators. The case went cold less than a year after Smith was killed.|
|A source close to the situation told FITSNews that Savage’s investigator recently questioned a man whose name appears in the investigation files. According to the source, the PI appeared to be pursuing the theory that Stephen was struck by a vehicle — despite the fact that SCHP investigators repeatedly said in their investigation there was no evidence of a vehicular fatality. in fact, a former investigator in the case told Fox News that it appeared as though Smith had been placed on the roadway.|
|SLED has been extremely tight-lipped about all of their Murdaugh-related investigations and has not commented publicly on any suspects or inquires pursued in the Smith investigation.|
|However, multiple sources in the Lowcountry have confirmed the agency is tracking some of the same reports Savage cited in his unauthorized interview — although it remains to be seen just how much daylight there is between those reports and the Murdaugh family.|
