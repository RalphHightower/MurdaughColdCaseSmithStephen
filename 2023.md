| **[Stephen Smith Investigation: An Update](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/03/09/stephen-smith-investigation-an-update/)** |
|Will the truth ever be uncovered?|
|This news outlet has expended significant bandwidth in the hopes of uncovering the truth about the murder of Stephen Smith – a homicide many believe is linked to the ‘Murdaugh Murders‘ crime and corruption saga. An openly gay teenager from Hampton, South Carolina, Smith was a star student at Wade Hampton High School and a friend of Buster Murdaugh. Buster is the oldest, surviving son of convicted killer Alex Murdaugh – who was sentenced to life in prison last week for murdering his wife and younger son on the family’s hunting property near Islandton, S.C. on June 7, 2021.|
|Smith’s body was dumped in the middle of Sandy Run Road near Crocketville, S.C. where it was discovered by a passing motorist at approximately 4:00 a.m. EST on the morning of July 8, 2015.|
|Who killed him? And why?|
|These questions have haunted Smith’s family for the past eight years … while simultaneously captivating journalists and documentarians who have been investigating the Murdaugh family.
Smith’s death was initially misclassified as a vehicular hit-and-run by Erin Presnell, a forensic pathologist at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Presnell reached this conclusion even though Smith’s injuries – which included a 7.25-inch laceration on the right side of his forehead – were inconsistent with a vehicular strike.|
|There was also zero evidence of a vehicular strike on the roadway where Smith’s body was found.|
|*“I saw no vehicle debris, skid marks or injuries consistent with someone being struck by a vehicle,”* trooper D.B. Rowell of the S.C. Highway Patrol (SCHP) wrote in his report describing the crime scene. *“We see no evidence to suggest the victim was struck by a vehicle.”* |
|Another SCHP investigator who walked the scene found *“no evidence of car parts or pieces”* on the scene, and the location of Smith’s body in the middle of the roadway was inconsistent with a vehicular strike.|
|Smith’s head wound produced so much blood it was initially confused for a gunshot blast.
As I have previously reported, SCHP troopers and investigators weren’t the only ones to express doubts regarding the “official narrative” of a vehicular strike. Following Smith’s autopsy, Hampton county coroner Ernie Washington told SCHP investigator Todd Proctor he *“(did) not agree with the pathologist stating that the victim was struck by a motor vehicle.”* |
|Still, Presnell stuck to her story – yet she offered nothing to support her claim other than the fact Smith’s body *“was found in the road.”*?|
|Given the questions surrounding Smith’s death, I called for an independent forensic review of Presnell’s autopsy findings – including the exhumation of Smith’s body from its resting place in Gooding Cemetery in Crocketville, S.C.|
|Smith’s mother – Sandy Smith – supported these efforts.|
|The investigation into Smith’s death is now back on the radar in a big way after it was prominently featured in the recently released Netflix documentary ‘Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal.’|
|Were the Murdaughs involved, though?|
|Speculation about potential Murdaugh connections to Smith’s death was certainly well-founded. For starters, the “Murdaugh” family name was mentioned more than forty times during the investigation into Smith’s death – and Alex Murdaugh’s brother and former law partner, Randy Murdaugh, was linked to at least three purported attempts to manipulate the course of the original investigation.|
|On December 15, 2015 – five months after Smith’s murder – SCHP investigators received a tip from Darrell Williams of Varnville, S.C. According to Williams, his stepson Patrick Wilson told him Shawn Connelly – another Hampton County teenager – was driving a vehicle which *“struck and killed Stephen Smith”* on the night in question.|
|Both Wilson and Connelly both lived in the area near where Stephen Smith’s body was found …|
|At the time of Wilson’s *“confession,”* he was facing attempted murder charges which were later dropped by the office of S.C. fourteenth circuit solicitor Duffie Stone. As regular readers are well aware, Stone’s office employed Alex Murdaugh as a badge-carrying attorney. Stone also followed Murdaugh’s father, grandfather and great-grandfather in office.|
|Additionally, on August 7, 2015 – one month after Smith’s death – Randy Murdaugh filed a motor vehicle accident lawsuit against Connelly on behalf of his client, Christopher Still. Less than a year later – on May 17, 2016 – another Murdaugh attorney filed another motor vehicle accident lawsuit against Connelly.|
|Both actions were later dismissed by Murdaugh-friendly judges in the fourteenth judicial circuit.|
|While those filings can certainly be explained away, the Murdaugh rumors exploded when agents of the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) opened a homicide investigation into Smith’s death just two weeks after the savage slayings of 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh and 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh on June 7, 2021 at Moselle – the Murdaugh family’s 1,700-acre hunting property straddling the Salkehatchie River on the border of Colleton and Hampton counties.|
|In announcing that inquiry, SLED specifically stated it was opening the Smith case *“based on information gathered during the course of the double murder investigation of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh.”* |
|Maddeningly, that statement has yet to be expounded upon …|
|SLED has reportedly made *“significant progress”* in its investigation of Smith’s murder, but it does not appear as though their investigation has any members of the Murdaugh family in its crosshairs.|
|Furthermore, sources familiar with the status of the inquiry are debunking rumors that any “evidence” – or any other information – related to Smith’s murder was obtained from Moselle in the aftermath of the murders of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh. Those rumors are false.|
|The information which led SLED to open its homicide investigation into Smith’s death was contained in the original 2015 SCHP report – not anything related to the Moselle murders.|
|*“SLED reviewed the file and agreed it was unlikely Stephen Smith’s death was attributable to a vehicular strike,”* a source close to the case confirmed.|
|In November of 2021, Charleston, S.C. attorney Andy Savage – who at the time was representing Smith’s family – gave an interview to WCIV TV-4 in which he indicated the Murdaughs were *“unconnected”* to Smith’s murder and any speculation that they were involved was *“unfounded.”* *“There are suspects we have in sight that are unconnected to Murdaugh,”* Savage told reporters Anne Emerson and Drew Tripp. *“The focus any in the media have on Murdaugh may be unfounded.”*|
|Sandy Smith recoiled at that revelation – and parted ways with Savage shortly thereafter.|
|However, sources close to the investigation did not dispute Savage’s characterization. In fact, they hinted strongly that his assessment may have been accurate.|
|*“What if he’s right?”* one well-placed law enforcement source told me at the time.|
| *“Everyone assumed it was the Murdaughs,”* one Hampton, S.C. source told me last fall. *“But there were a lot of people in (Stephen Smith’s) little black book.”* |
|Speaking of that *“little black book,”* this news outlet recently reviewed files extracted from at least one personal electronic device purportedly used by Smith (and in his possession) at or around the time of his death. That review strongly suggested Smith was engaged in what could charitably be described as high-risk behavior at the time he was killed.|
|According to my sources, investigators have been digging through these files in the hopes of identifying who is responsible for his unsolved murder.|
|To be clear: All this news outlet wants (and has ever wanted) is for the family and friends of Stephen Smith to receive justice – and for the individual(s) responsible for his murder to be held accountable for their actions.|
|Smith’s death was clearly no accident, and his family deserves to know who killed him … and why.|
|Are we closer to achieving those objectives today than we were when SLED opened this case nearly two years ago? Yes. Will people invested in certain outcomes like where the case ultimately winds up? Probably not …|
|But the job of a journalist is to follow the the truth … wherever it leads and however uncomfortable that journey may become. Anything less than that is a disservice to the truth and to the memory of all victims of violent crimes.|

| *“I have tried my best to ignore the vicious rumors …”*  |
|The surviving son of convicted killer Alex Murdaugh wants to make something abundantly clear: He is no murderer.|
|Buster Murdaugh, who testified on his father’s behalf during the latter’s double homicide trial in Walterboro, South Carolina last month, issue a statement on Monday morning shooting down rumors of his alleged involvement in a case that has been linked to the ‘Murdaugh Murders’ crime and corruption saga.|
|Murdaugh issued his statement in connection with the still-unsolved murder of Stephen Smith – a Hampton County teenager who was killed on July 8, 2015.|
| *“These baseless rumors of my involvement with Stephen and his death are false,”* Murdaugh said in the statement, which was released exclusively to NBC’s Today show. *“I unequivocally deny any involvement in his death.”*|

| ***— TODAY (@TODAYSHOW) MARCH 20, 2023*** |
|Here is the statement from Buster Murdaugh in its entirety …|
| ***I have tried my best to ignore the vicious rumors about my involvement in Stephen Smith’s tragic death that continue to be published in the media as I grieve over the brutal murders of my mother and brother. I love them so much and miss them terribly.*** |
| ***I haven’t spoken up until now because I want to live in private while I cope with their deaths and my father’s incarceration.***  |
| ***Before, during and since my father’s trial, I have been targeted and harassed by the media and followers of this story.***  |
| ***This has gone on far too long.***  |
| ***These baseless rumors of my involvement with Stephen and his death are false.***  |
| ***I unequivocally deny any involvement in his death, and my heart goes out to the Smith family.*** |
| ***I am requesting that the media immediately stop publishing these defamatory comments and rumors about me.*** |

| *“Significant progress”* has been made in the investigation, we are told – although as I have previously reported that progress does not appear to be focused on any members of the Murdaugh family (at least as it relates to Smith’s murder).|

|According to my sources, law enforcement investigators have been digging through these files in the hopes of identifying who is responsible for his unsolved murder.|
|This news outlet published an extensive update on the Smith case earlier this month … and just last week Smith’s mother, Sandy Smith, launched a GoFundMe campaign seeking to raise money for her late son’s exhumation and an independent forensic examination of his body.|
|That page raised more than $60,000.|
|Sandy Smith held a news conference on Monday morning with her new attorneys, Eric Bland and Ronnie Richter, announcing they were launching a *“new investigation”* into Smith’s death – including a petition to exhume Smith’s body. That petition is expected to be filed within the next ten days, with Bland telling reporters he was *“confident”* the court would approve it.|
|This news outlet called for an independent forensic review of Presnell’s autopsy findings – including the exhumation of Smith’s body from its resting place in Gooding Cemetery in Crocketville, S.C. – over a year ago.|
| *“It is abundantly clear an independent review of Presnell’s autopsy of Stephen Smith must be conducted immediately – up to and including the exhumation of Smith’s body from its resting place in Gooding Cemetery in Crocketville, S.C.,”* I wrote last February. *“Such a drastic step may be the only way to start uncovering the truth.”* |
|During their news conference on Monday morning, Bland and Richter were asked about Buster Murdaugh’s statement.|
| *“There’s no reason to discuss Buster Murdaugh – and there’s no reason to comment back to Buster Murdaugh,”* Richter said.|
|Moments later, though, Bland indicated the investigation was not focused on either Buster or the Murdaugh family.|
| *“We have no knowledge of Buster or any of the Murdaughs having anything to do with this,”* Bland said.|
|SLED had no immediate comment Monday morning in response to any of the new developments in Stephen Smith’s case. Nor did the office of S.C. attorney general Alan Wilson, which has been leading all of the various Murdaugh-related prosecutions.|
| **[Mother of Hampton teen Stephen Smith hires attorneys to re-investigate mysterious death](https://www.postandcourier.com/murdaugh-updates/mother-of-hampton-teen-stephen-smith-hires-attorneys-to-re-investigate-mysterious-death/article_876a7830-c727-11ed-b9a2-cbd08c73a531.html)** |
|The mother of Stephen Smith, a Hampton teen whose mysterious 2015 death has garnered attention in the wake of the Murdaugh saga, plans to ask that a judge allow her son’s body to be exhumed as part of a renewed investigation. Sandy Smith has retained South Carolina attorneys Ronnie Richter and Eric Bland to re-examine the case. She will use more than $65,000 raised through a GoFundMe campaign to launch a new, private investigation into the case, the attorneys said March 20.|
|Stephen, 19, was found dead July 8, 2015, on Sandy Run Road near Joe Miley Road in Hampton. Investigators initially believed he was killed in a hit-and-run collision while walking outside because his car ran out of gas. It is a theory his mother has never accepted. There were no skid marks or vehicular debris near his body and loosely tied shoes were still on his feet, Richter said. Authorities found Stephen’s car about 3 miles away on Bamberg Road with its gas cap removed, making it appear as though his car broke down and Stephen was walking to find help, the lawyer said. Stephen never used his cell phone to call for assistance, and his wallet was left behind in his car — both out of character for the nursing student, his mother said. The attorneys believe a *“fresh set of eyes”* will yield different conclusions, that Stephen was killed somewhere else, and his body was dumped in the middle of the road to look like a hit-and-run.|
|As one of the only openly gay men in the tiny town of Hampton, Stephen *“had to be cautious”* and live a *“secret life”* to some extent, Bland said. The attorneys said the case’s first step is its most crucial: asking a judge to grant them permission to exhume Stephen’s body, per state law. They plan to file the petition within the next 10 days, Bland said. They will simultaneously begin hiring experts who have conducted autopsies on exhumed bodies.|
|Stephen Smith’s case received renewed attention following the June 7, 2021, killings of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh, members of a prominent Lowcountry legal dynasty. Alex Murdaugh, Maggie’s husband and Paul’s father, was convicted of their murders in March following a lengthy and highly publicized trial. State Law Enforcement Division agents confirmed June 22, 2021, they had opened an investigation into Stephen’s death based on information gathered during the course of the double-murder case. The Murdaugh named popped up multiple times in files kept by South Carolina Highway Patrol, which conducted the original investigation into Smith’s death.|
|But Charleston lawyer Andy Savage, who began representing Sandy Smith shortly after SLED opened its case, told ABC News 4 in October 2021 that speculation regarding the Murdaughs’ involvement may be *“unfounded.”* His investigation identified potential suspects who were *“unconnected”* to the family, Savage said. Sandy Smith ultimately dropped Savage as her attorney.|
|Bland mentioned during the March 20 news conference that a grand jury was impaneled at some point to probe Stephen’s death. It’s no longer in session, however, which could mean one of two things, he said. Grand jurors returned an indictment and the S.C. Attorney General’s Office is , *“sitting on it,”* which Bland said he highly doubts, or there wasn’t enough evidence presented. Bland stressed their case is a *“Stephen Smith 2.0”* — it’s not about the Murdaughs. Right now, the attorneys have *“no knowledge at all”* about the family *“having anything to do with this,”* he said.|
Still, speculation has continued to swirl in the aftermath of Alex Murdaugh’s six-week double-murder trial, which drew a global audience.|
|Various news outlets and documentaries have continued to plumb rumors into possible ties between Stephen and Buster Murdaugh, the remaining son of Alex Murdaugh. Buster’s name was one of several invoked in the S.C. Highway Patrol’s investigation of Stephen’s death as rumors reached investigators, the case file shows. But none of the rumors bore fruit. The Post and Courier has chosen not to report on this conjecture due to a lack of verifiable evidence and sources.|
|Buster Murdaugh released a written statement through a publicist on March 20 decrying *“the vicious rumors about my involvement in Stephen Smith’s tragic death.”* He said he had not spoken out before this point because he has been trying to live privately while he grieves the loss of his mother and brother and copes with his father’s incarceration. *“Before, during and since my father’s trial, I have been targeted and harassed by the media and followers of this story. This has gone on far too long,”* he stated. *“These baseless rumors of my involvement with Stephen and his death are false. I unequivocally deny any involvement in his death, and my heart goes out to the Smith family.  I am requesting that the media immediately stop publishing these defamatory comments and rumors about me,”* he said.|
|Buster and his girlfriend, Brooklyn White, have grown increasingly frustrated in recent weeks as members of the media have shown up at and around the home on Hilton Head Island where the couple have been staying, according to reports filed with the Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office. The reports detail the interactions as follows: On March 5, Buster told deputies he had been alerted to The New York Post publishing a photo of him inside the home. He told deputies he suspected the photographer had been in a car parked outside his home the previous evening. Deputies pledged to have extra patrols monitor the house, and they explained the procedures to pressing trespassing charges and obtaining a restraining order. The same day, White called the sheriff’s office to say she and Buster were being followed by *“the media”* in an SUV. Deputies stopped the vehicle after seeing it make an improper lane change. They noted the driver had a camera bag on the front seat. The man was given a warning for the traffic violation.|
|The following day, White called deputies again to report that the behavior of certain members of the press had become *“increasingly unsettling and frightening.”* She explained that she left her home and spotted a YouTube show host looking in the windows of her vehicle. She told deputies that two reporters also had been milling about, talking to neighbors and photographing her walking her dogs. Deputies noted that Buster Murdaugh requested to be left off the complaints and subsequent reports *“due to privacy concerns.”* |

| *“This investigation is being deliberately derailed …”* |
Over the coming days and weeks, this news outlet will be releasing documents and other materials in connection with our ongoing investigation into the July 8, 2015 murder of Stephen Smith of Hampton, South Carolina. Our goal in releasing this information is to let the public see what we are seeing as we continue our deep dive into this unsolved mystery.|
|Smith’s death is back on the radar in a big way after it was featured in the hit Netflix documentary ‘Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal.’|
|As this article goes to press, there is an ongoing criminal investigation into Smith’s murder being led by the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED). That investigation has reportedly made *“significant progress”* – but has yet to yield any arrests. I will have more information on the status of SLED’S probe soon …|
|Just this week, Buster Murdaugh – the surviving son of convicted killer Alex Murdaugh – issued a statement denying any involvement in Smith’s death, slamming “baseless” and “vicious” rumors to the contrary.|
|Initially misclassified as a vehicular hit-and-run, SLED opened a homicide investigation into Smith’s death just two weeks after the savage slayings of 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh and 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh on June 7, 2021 at Moselle – the Murdaugh family’s 1,700-acre hunting property straddling the Salkehatchie River on the border of Colleton and Hampton counties. Alex Murdaugh was convicted of those killings and sentenced to life in prison.|
|Contrary to popular perception, SLED’s investigation into Stephen Smith’s death was not based on any evidence or information obtained at Moselle – but rather the agency receiving a copy of the original 2015 S.C. Highway Patrol  (SCHP) accident report. *“SLED reviewed the file and agreed it was unlikely Stephen Smith’s death was attributable to a vehicular strike,”* a source close to the case confirmed. |
|That document is one of the many Smith-related items this news outlet will be releasing this week.|
|SLED’s investigation isn’t the only game in town, though.|
|On Monday, Smith’s mother – Sandy Smith of Barnwell, S.C. – introduced attorneys Eric Bland and Ronnie Richter as her new lawyers. Bland and Richter promptly announced they would be leading their own investigation into Smith’s murder. That inquiry will begin next week with a formal request to exhume Smith’s body for the purposes of conducting an independent review of the initial autopsy performed by Erin Presnell, a forensic pathologist at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC).|
|This news outlet supports Bland and Richter in their efforts. In fact, I penned a column over a year ago on this very subject. *“It is abundantly clear an independent review of Presnell’s autopsy of Stephen Smith must be conducted … up to and including the exhumation of Smith’s body from its resting place in Gooding Cemetery in Crocketville, S.C.,”* I wrote last February. *“Such a drastic step may be the only way to start uncovering the truth.”* |
|What does Smith believe is the “truth” about what happened to her son?|
|On September 28, 2016 – a little over fourteen months after her son’s murder – Sandy Smith wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) headquarters in Washington, D.C. seeking the agency’s assistance in her son’s case. In her letter to the FBI – one of the first case files we are releasing – Smith noted *“it has been apparent from the first week of this investigation that authorities are covering up critical evidence, and we no longer know who to trust.”* *“This investigation is being deliberately derailed,”* Smith wrote. Smith made it clear in her letter the primary suspect in her son’s death was Buster Murdaugh – and that the Murdaugh family was attempting to cover up his involvement in the crime.|
|*“The first call my family received after the murder was from authorities notifying us of Stephen’s death,”* Smith wrote. *“The second came very quickly the same morning from solicitor Randolph Murdaugh. In fact, he called my ex-husband’s cell phone as we waited in the police station for a positive identification. He said he heard of the case and was interested in working pro bono as a liaison between the family and investigators.”* *“Stephen’s father accepted the offer, although we were unsure why Mr. Murdaugh wanted to help us,”* Smith continued. *“We also weren’t sure how he found out so quickly – even before it was confirmed to be our son.”* |
|According to Sandy Smith, *“surprisingly, after just a few interactions, Mr. Murdaugh stopped returning our calls.”* Shortly thereafter, Smith’s twin sister – 26-year-old Stephanie Joyner – was approached *“multiple times by peers”* who indicated the Murdaughs were somehow involved in her brother’s death.|
|Joyner, readers will recall, has a child with Yemassee, S.C. police chief Greg Alexander – an alleged Murdaugh family *“fixer”* who is said to be the focus of an ongoing statewide grand jury investigation related to the family. *“As a family, it was suspicious to us since he had taken such an immediate interest in the case and then became unreachable so quickly,”* Smith wrote in her letter to the FBI.|
|Several weeks later, Smith said an unnamed witness told yet another member of her family that he was present when Stephen was murdered – and that the killer was Buster Murdaugh. According to this witness, Buster Murdaugh allegedly *“beat Stephen to death with a baseball bat … because Stephen was gay.”* *“The witness said they were out smashing mailboxes when they came upon Stephen, and Buster seized the opportunity,”* Smith wrote in her letter. *“The young man (said) that Buster threatened to kill him if he ever spoke up. This information was given to investigators but nothing has come of it.”* |
|Smith also reported an *“alleged conversation”* between a schoolmate of Buster’s littler brother, Paul, and school officials. *“I was told (the schoolmate) claimed to have knowledge of the murder and implicated Buster as the murderer,”* she wrote. Again, though, Sandy Smith claimed in her letter to the feds that was *“no further follow-up”* on this information.|
|*“The Murdaughs are probably the most prominent family in Hampton County,”* Sandy Smith wrote to the FBI. *“Stephen had on more than one occasion mentioned to friends and his twin sister that he was involved romantically with someone from a prominent family in the county who was hiding his sexuality. He said it would shock people to know this person was gay. We suspect this could be the young man Stephen was referring to, though he never named him.”* Sandy Smith went on to accuse Buster Murdaugh of getting rid of his *“old vehicle”* following the murder – which according to her was *“critical”* because she and others believed *“there (was) DNA in Buster’s old vehicle.”* |
|A year before sending her letter to the FBI, Smith claimed to have submitted a *“plea for help”* to former S.C. governor – and current 2024 presidential candidate – Nikki Haley. To her surprise, Haley not only responded but made the case an investigative priority *“She responded promptly and assigned new investigators to the case,”* Smith wrote back. *“While it appeared to be the answer to our prayers, very little progress (was) made and they say they have exhausted their leads.”* |
|As I have repeatedly pointed out, speculation about potential Murdaugh connections to Smith’s death was certainly well-founded. For starters, the “Murdaugh” family name was mentioned more than forty times during the investigation into Smith’s death – and Alex Murdaugh’s brother and former law partner, Randy Murdaugh, was linked to at least three purported attempts to manipulate the course of the original investigation. These connections – and the allegations raised by Sandy Smith in her September 2018 letter – cannot be ignored. Then again, neither can allegations that Smith was engaged in what I have described previously as *“high-risk behavior,”* including numerous illicit liaisons detailed in files extracted from at least one personal electronic device purportedly used by Smith (and in his possession) at or around the time of his death.|
| *“Everyone assumed it was the Murdaughs,”* one Hampton, S.C. source told me last fall. *“But there were a lot of people in (Stephen Smith’s) little black book.”* In recent weeks, public reaction to Smith’s case seems to have segregated into warring sections at some sporting event – with jeering voices dominating the discussion and all manner of agenda-driven preconceptions pushing truth to the sidelines.|
|We are not participating in such a game. *“The job of a journalist is to follow the the truth … wherever it leads and however uncomfortable that journey may become,”* I wrote earlier this month. *“Anything less than that is a disservice to the truth and to the memory of all victims.”* |

| *“Pending further investigation, the manner of death is best left undetermined.”* |
|As I noted earlier this week, my news outlet is releasing documents and other materials in connection with our ongoing investigation into the July 8, 2015 murder of Stephen Smith of Hampton, South Carolina.|
|Smith’s murder is back on the radar in a big way after it was featured prominently in the hit Netflix documentary, ‘Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal.’ Is there a Murdaugh connection to Smith’s murder? Smith’s family certainly believes so … although Buster Murdaugh, who was friends with Smith in high school, issued his own statement on the situation earlier this week.|
|To recap: Smith’s body was dumped in the middle of Sandy Run Road near Crocketville, S.C. in the earlyⁿ morning hours of July 8, 2015 – where it was discovered by a passing motorist (a tow truck driver) at approximately 4:00 a.m. EDT.|
|Initially misclassified as a vehicular hit-and-run, the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) opened a homicide investigation into Smith’s death shortly after the savage slayings of 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh and 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh on June 7, 2021 at Moselle – the Murdaugh family’s 1,700-acre hunting property straddling the Salkehatchie River on the border of Colleton and Hampton counties. Disbarred attorney Alex Murdaugh was convicted of those killings and sentenced to life in prison earlier this month.|
|The misclassification of Smith’s death as a hit-and-run was based on an autopsy performed by Erin Presnell, a forensic pathologist at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). This news outlet has written about this autopsy on dozens of occasions over the past few years – detailing the controversy that raged at the time between crime scene investigators and Presnell over the manner of Smith’s death.|
|Earlier this week, Smith’s mother – Sandy Smith of Barnwell, S.C. – joined attorneys Eric Bland and Ronnie Richter in announcing they would be submitting a formal request to exhume Smith’s body for the purposes of conducting an independent review of Presnell’s autopsy. This news outlet supports Bland and Richter in their efforts – having penned a column over a year ago on this very subject.|
|As Bland and Richter prepare their petition, I felt it worthwhile to publish the original autopsy file as part of this news outlet’s ongoing effort to provide important materials to the public related to this case.|
|Why? Because I believe it is vitally important for people to see this information for themselves … and reach decisions based on facts, not people pushing one agenda or another.
According to Presnell, Smith’s cause of death was “blunt head trauma due to (a) motor vehicle crash, pedestrian vs. vehicle.” Despite this reference, the manner of Smith’s death is listed as “undetermined” – a mystery which has lingered for the past seven-and-a-half years.|
|Presnell conducted the autopsy of Smith’s body at 12:30 p.m. EDT on July 8, 2015 – approximately eight-and-a-half hours after he died. In fact, at the time of the examination his body was still *“warm to the touch.”* Presnell diagnosed *“brainstem rent (stretch) with associated parenchymal hemorrhages,”* or a stretching of the brain stem accompanied by multiple instances of bleeding within the brain. She also observed a *“cerebral contusion”? of the right temporal lobe along with *“extensive skull fractures.”* Smith’s right shoulder was dislocated and he had sustained *“irregular abrasions and contusions”* on both the right and left arms. On the right side of his forehead was a significant laceration – 7.25 inches in length – which extended *“across the superior mid-to-right lateral forehead, involving the right eyebrow.”* There was also *“blood and froth”* in Smith’s airways.|
|During the autopsy, deputy Colleton County coroner Kelly Green was given the khaki shorts, black sneakers and black Nike T-shirt Smith was wearing at the time of his death – as well as fingernail clippings, dried blood, pulled scalp hair and multiple swabs from various parts of Smith’s body. After the autopsy, Green received a compact disc containing all of the digital images.|
| *“In light of historical information and the autopsy findings, it is the opinion of the pathologist that the decedent died as the result of blunt head trauma sustained in a motor vehicle crash in which the decedent was a pedestrian struck by a vehicle,”* Presnell concluded in her report. Although she added *“pending further investigation, the manner of death is best left undetermined.”*
Presnell’s assessment of a hit-and-run has been controversial from the very beginning considering there was zero evidence of a vehicular strike on the roadway where Smith’s body was found. |
| *“I saw no vehicle debris, skid marks or injuries consistent with someone being struck by a vehicle,”* SCHP trooper D.B. Rowell wrote in his report describing the crime scene. *“We see no evidence to suggest the victim was struck by a vehicle.”* |
|Another SCHP investigator who walked the scene found *“no evidence of car parts or pieces”* on the scene, and noted the location of Smith’s body in the middle of the roadway was inconsistent with a vehicular strike. SCHP troopers and investigators weren’t the only ones who didn’t buy the *“official story.”* Following the autopsy, Hampton county coroner Ernie Washington told SCHP investigator Todd Proctor he *“(did) not agree with the pathologist stating that the victim was struck by a motor vehicle.”* SCHP investigators questioned Presnell about her conclusion – but got nowhere. On July 22, 2015 – twelve days after Smith’s death – Proctor tried to speak to Presnell about why she settled on the *“hit-and-run”* explanation, but was rudely rebuffed.|
|After attempting to stonewall the SCHP investigator, Presnell allegedly *“called (him) a liar.”*  Pressed as to what led her to conclude Smith had been killed by a vehicle strike, Presnell responded *“because he was found in the road,”* according to Proctor’s case notes.  *“She had no evidence other than that for the statement being put in the report,”* Proctor wrote in his case notes. The kicker? Presnell dismissed Procter from her office by telling him it was *“(his) job to figure out what struck (Smith), not hers.”*  |
|A month later, on August 18, 2015, Proctor noted he was *“unaware”* of any alleged *“historical information”* which may have been relied upon by Presnell in memorializing the hit-and-run theory. Proctor’s case notes from that day included yet another shocking statement …  *“The coroner stated that he had made contact with the pathologist, Dr. Presnell, and she stated that she would be willing to change her report to read however he wanted it,”* Proctor’s notes read.|
|And people wonder why South Carolina is so messed up …|
|Stay tuned: In addition to publishing more documents related to the Smith case this week, we plan on providing another update on the status of the ongoing investigation into who may have been responsible for it.|

| **[SLED Releases Statement On Stephen Smith Investigation](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/03/22/sled-releases-statement-on-stephen-smith-investigation/)** |
|Agency provides update on murder probe *“in the interest of accuracy, understanding and the continued mission of seeking justice …”* |
|Twenty-four hours after chief Mark Keel of the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) confirmed that his agency was treating the death of Stephen Smith as a homicide – and devoting additional resources to solving the case – the agency released a statement regarding the high-profile murder investigation.|
|The body of Smith – a 19-year-old from Hampton, S.C. – was dumped in the middle of Sandy Run Road near Crocketville, S.C. in the early morning hours of July 8, 2015. It was discovered by a passing motorist (a tow truck driver) at approximately 4:00 a.m. EDT.|
|Initially misclassified as a vehicular hit-and-run based on the findings of Erin Presnell, a forensic pathologist at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Smith’s case has attracted international attention after it was prominently featured in the hit Netflix documentary, ‘Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal.’|
|SLED opened a homicide investigation into Smith’s death shortly after the savage slayings of 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh and 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh on June 7, 2021 at Moselle – the Murdaugh family’s 1,700-acre hunting property straddling the Salkehatchie River on the border of Colleton and Hampton counties. Disbarred attorney Alex Murdaugh was convicted of those killings and sentenced to life in prison for them earlier this month.|
|SLED’s statement was an unusual move for the agency – which typically refuses to discuss ongoing investigations. It was disseminated *“in the interest of accuracy, understanding and the continued mission of seeking justice for victims of crimes,”* according to the release. The statement provided insight into the role SLED crime scene agents perform when they receive calls for service from local law enforcement agencies – which is happening with increasing frequency in the Palmetto State. SLED’s primary mission in such cases is to *“provide quality manpower and technical assistance”* to these local agencies. To dispel rumors the Smith investigation was *“re-opened,”* the press release clarified that SLED agents frequently assist local law enforcement agencies in their investigations and that the involvement of its officers at a crime scene *“does not automatically indicate a SLED investigation.”* |
|SLED agents did attend Smith’s autopsy – at which Presnell controversially concluded Smith died from being struck by a motor vehicle. Following this determination, *“the Hampton County Sheriff’s Office requested the South Carolina Highway Patrol (SCHP) to investigate Mr. Smith’s death,”* not SLED. Neither Hampton County nor SCHP asked SLED to conduct an investigation into Smith’s death in 2015.|
|As previously reported, Presnell’s misclassification of Smith’s murder as a hit-and-run effectively shut down inquiries into other potential causes of death. Presnell reached her controversial conclusion despite the fact there was zero evidence of a vehicular strike on the roadway where Smith’s body was found.|
| *“I saw no vehicle debris, skid marks or injuries consistent with someone being struck by a vehicle,”* SCHP trooper D.B. Rowell wrote in his report describing the crime scene. *“We see no evidence to suggest the victim was struck by a vehicle.”* |
|SLED’s statement affirmed the agency opened – not re-opened – its investigation into Smith’s death on June 23, 2021. The investigation was opened after agents received information about Smith’s death contained within the SCHP investigative file – in which state troopers made it clear they *“did not believe the death was a hit and run by a motor vehicle.”* |
|This investigative file was published today by FITSNews as part of our ongoing coverage of this case. |
|SLED stated its investigation into Smith’s murder is *“active and ongoing,”* and *“was never closed – it remains a homicide investigation.”* hief Keel has assigned additional SLED Lowcountry regional agents to work on Smith’s case in the hopes *“those who may know what happened to Mr. Smith are more willing to speak freely now than they may have been in 2015 or 2021.”* |
| **[Stephen Smith Case Files: The Report That Launched The Murder Investigation](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/03/22/stephen-smith-case-files-the-report-that-launched-the-murder-investigation/)** |
|An old case file … and new leads.|
|All week, my news outlet has been releasing documents and other materials tied to our ongoing investigation into the July 8, 2015 murder of Stephen Smith of Hampton, South Carolina. Today’s document drop is perhaps the most significant as it comes at an incredibly important moment in the ongoing investigation into Smith’s murder – which was prominently featured in the hit Netflix documentary, ‘Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal.’|
| *“Stephen Smith’s death has haunted a South Carolina community for years – but it was a Netflix documentary, released around the same time as the double murder trial involving a prominent family, that revived attention to the case,”* reporter Andrea Cavallier noted for The (U.K.) Daily Mail.|
|Initially misclassified as a vehicular hit-and-run, the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) opened a homicide investigation into Smith’s death shortly after the savage slayings of 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh and 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh on June 7, 2021 at Moselle – the Murdaugh family’s 1,700-acre hunting property straddling the Salkehatchie River on the border of Colleton and Hampton counties. Disbarred attorney Alex Murdaugh was convicted of those killings and sentenced to life in prison earlier this month.|
|There has been a lot of discussion as to what prompted SLED to open that homicide probe. Today, the public will get to view the file that led them to do so … the original 2015 S.C. Highway Patrol (SCHP) *“Multi-Disciplinary Accident Investigation Team”* (MAIT) report into Smith’s death.|
|Contrary to popular perception, SLED’s investigation into Stephen Smith’s death was not based on any evidence or information obtained at Moselle – but rather the agency obtaining a copy of the MAIT report. *“Anyone who reads that file knows it was not a hit-and-run,”* one law enforcement source told me this week. *“But even if it was a hit-and-run, it’s still a vehicular homicide.”* |
|As you will see, the Murdaugh name is ALL OVER this case file … and Smith’s mother, Sandy Smith of Barnwell, S.C., has made it abundantly clear she believes Murdaugh’s son, 26-year-old Buster Murdaugh, was somehow involved in the murder. Buster Murdaugh issued a statement earlier this week denying any involvement in Smith’s killing, decrying any suggestion to the contrary as a *“vicious rumor.”* |
|As I mentioned, the release of these documents comes at a pivotal moment in the investigation. This week, SLED chief Mark Keel confirmed to Sandy Smith that his agency was treating her son’s death as a homicide. Keel also told Smith’s new attorney, Eric Bland, that SLED was devoting additional resources to solving his murder.|
|Bland and his law partner, Ronnie Richter, are running their own investigation into Smith’s death. That inquiry includes the potential exhumation of Smith’s body for the purposes of conducting an independent review of the controversial autopsy performed on July 8, 2015 by Erin Presnell, a forensic pathologist at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC).|
|This news outlet published Presnell’s original autopsy report yesterday as part of our ongoing coverage of this case.|
|Presnell’s findings are what led to the official misclassification of Smith’s death as a hit-and-run – effectively shutting down law enforcement inquiries into other potential causes. Presnell reached her controversial conclusion even though there was zero evidence of a vehicular strike on the roadway where Smith’s body was found.|
|*“I saw no vehicle debris, skid marks or injuries consistent with someone being struck by a vehicle,”* SCHP trooper D.B. Rowell wrote in his report describing the crime scene. *“We see no evidence to suggest the victim was struck by a vehicle.”* Another SCHP investigator who walked the scene found *“no evidence of car parts or pieces”* on the scene, and noted the location of Smith’s body in the middle of the roadway was inconsistent with a vehicular strike.|
|In light of this controversy, I have consistently supported the exhumation of Smith’s body and the independent autopsy review now being advocated by Bland and Richter. In fact I penned a column over a year ago on this very subject. *“It is abundantly clear an independent review of Presnell’s autopsy of Stephen Smith must be conducted … up to and including the exhumation of Smith’s body from its resting place in Gooding Cemetery in Crocketville, S.C.,”* I wrote last February. *“Such a drastic step may be the only way to start uncovering the truth.”* |
|Uncovering the truth could lead us down some dark paths, though …|
|As I have noted in previous reports, Smith was engaged in what can charitably be described as *“high-risk behavior,”* including numerous illicit liaisons detailed in files extracted from at least one personal electronic device purportedly used by Smith (and in his possession) around the time of his death.|
|Bland and Richter have indicated they plan on investigating Smith’s communications in the weeks and days leading up to his murder. Will they be examining all of those files as well?|
| *“Everyone assumed it was the Murdaughs,”* one Hampton, S.C. source told me last fall. *“But there were a lot of people in (Stephen Smith’s) little black book.”* |
|There were, indeed …|
|And while SLED does not believe any Murdaugh family members were directly involved in Smith’s murder, the specter of the family’s influence still hangs over the investigation – including two individuals currently believed to be the top suspects in Smith’s killing.|
|Smith also spent much of the weekend before he died with an individual linked closely to Alex Murdaugh and convicted fraudster Russell Laffitte – a Hampton, S.C. convenience store owner by the name of Kash Patel. *“The only people he talked about was he was hanging around … the guy named Kash,”* Sandy Smith told SCHP investigators during a July 17, 2015 interview. *“That was really his only friends in Hampton.”* Smith added that Patel and her son had taken a trip to Hilton Head Island shortly before his death. *“The guy named Kash that owns the (gas station) right there in Varnville,”* Smith continued. *“Stephen used to talk about him, they … they were all friends. It was a group of them and they would go have parties or something.”* |
|Patel was referenced by Laffitte in a February 24, 2022 deposition conducted by Amy Hill, a Columbia, S.C. attorney appointed to help oversee Murdaugh’s financial assets in connection with a pending civil case. According to Laffitte, he and Murdaugh would cash checks at the gas station owned by Patel’s family. *“If I needed $1,000 to cash at 10:00 (p.m.) at night, I’d say, hey, Kash, I need you to cash a check for me for $1,000,”* Laffitte said during the deposition. *“He would do it.”* |
|According to our sources, Keel called Bland on Tuesday to discuss progress made in the investigation – as well as to talk about the potential exhumation of Smith’s remains.|
| *“SLED officials have revealed that they did not need to exhume Stephen Smith’s body to convince them that his death was a homicide,”* Bland and Richter said in a statement. *“However, they will be present and participate in any exhumation of Stephen’s body to gather more evidence. We are committed to finding out what really happened, and getting the peace and justice the Smith family deserves.”* |
|This news outlet is also committed to finding out what really happened to Smith – which is more important now than ever given the factionalism that has been driving public discussion of this case.|
|*“The job of a journalist is to follow the the truth … wherever it leads and however uncomfortable that journey may become,”* I wrote earlier this month. *“Anything less than that is a disservice to the truth and to the memory of all victims.”* |
| **[SLED adds agents to Stephen Smith probe, hoping Murdaugh verdict will drive tips](https://www.postandcourier.com/murdaugh-updates/sled-adds-agents-to-stephen-smith-probe-hoping-murdaugh-verdict-will-drive-tips/article_a373e8c4-c8e7-11ed-8851-6f5277515d0f.html)** |
| The State Law Enforcement Division is assigning more agents to investigate the death of Stephen Smith, the Hampton County teenager found in the middle of a road in 2015, in hope that the conviction of former attorney Alex Murdaugh will encourage more people to come forward with information. And in an update on the case March 22, SLED described the case as a *“homicide investigation,”* its strongest indication yet that it suspects foul play. Smith’s death was initially categorized as a hit-and-run, in large part because of where his body was found. SLED said it opened an investigation into Smith’s death in 2021 because it was *“apparent”* that S.C. Highway Patrol investigators didn’t believe he was struck by a vehicle, even though a medical examiner did.|
|Highway Patrol troopers recorded their doubts in their report on the case. They reported that they didn’t see any evidence of a collision, like debris or skid marks on the road. Smith’s loosely tied shoes were still on his feet, though they likely would have fallen off if he was struck by a vehicle. Troopers even argued with the medical examiner about her conclusions, their case file shows, and in interviews with Hampton County residents, they openly said they believed Smith was murdered.|
|Still, in describing the case as a suspected homicide, SLED vindicated doubts long harbored by Smith’s mother, Sandy, who has never believed her son was killed in a hit-and-run.|
|Sandy Smith and her attorney Eric Bland first disclosed the agency’s stepped-up language after Bland spoke with SLED’s chief, Mark Keel, on March 21. In an interview with NewsNation, Sandy Smith said she was both shocked and elated to hear SLED agreed with her. She called it news she’d been waiting for. *“I just knew in my heart that what they were telling me wasn’t true,”* she said of the hit-and-run description.|
|SLED opened its investigation into Smith’s death just weeks after Murdaugh’s wife, Maggie, and son Paul were found dead at the family’s hunting estate in June 2021. At the time, the agency said it was taking on Smith’s case based on information gleaned from the Murdaugh homicide investigation. The agency now says its hope is that *“those who may know what happened to Mr. Smith are more willing to speak freely now than they may have been in 2015 or 2021.”* A SLED spokeswoman declined to say when additional agents were assigned to the case, or how many were added. Though no evidence has publicly surfaced linking the Murdaugh family to Smith, his case has been heavily influenced by the flood of national interest that the murders of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh brought to Hampton County, a place where their family long held sway. Alex Murdaugh was convicted March 2 of killing his wife and son after a trial that routinely led the national news.|
|A week after Murdaugh’s guilty verdict was read, Sandy Smith asked for donations to have her son’s body exhumed so a new pathologist could render an opinion on his cause of death. Fueled by interest in the Murdaugh case, her initial request for $15,000 has yielded more than $90,000 in contributions, and she hired Bland’s law firm to spearhead a fresh look at the case. Sandy Smith’s attorneys hope a reexamination of his body can conclusively rule out the theory that his injuries were caused by a vehicle strike. They’re expected to file a petition to exhume his body in the coming days. The attorneys also plan to more closely examine data from his phone to see who he’d been interacting with. Smith was openly gay in a small community, which the family attorneys believe may have led him to keep some things from his family and friends.|
|Smith, a 2014 graduate of Wade Hampton High School who was studying nursing, was found dead in the middle of Sandy Run Road, between a corn field and a timber stand about 3 miles from his car. While the car’s gas cap was off and it wouldn’t start, giving the appearance of car trouble, he hadn’t called for help, and he’d left his wallet behind.|
|Anyone with information about Smith’s death can report a tip by calling SLED at (803) 737-9000 and asking for the investigative services department.|

| **[Stephen Smith Case Files: The Initial Interviews](https://www.fitsnews.com/2023/03/30/stephen-smith-case-files-the-initial-interviews/)** |
|Promising leads coming full circle? Or a cold case getting colder …|
|As the investigation into the still-unsolved murder of Stephen Smith continues, this news outlet has been releasing case files and other information obtained over the course of our extensive inquiries into this ongoing mystery. Today, we are publishing an update on the case which includes several important files … audio interviews conducted with four individuals in the immediate aftermath of Smith’s brutal murder on July 8, 2015. As fictitious New York City cop Max McLaughlin said in Netflix’s The Defeated, *“a crime scene is like a stove with the heat turned off.”* *“It gets colder by the minute,”* he added.|
|That makes Stephen Smith’s murder a definitional cold case … which is why we have endeavored to go back to the beginning of the investigation in the hopes of cutting through the recent sensationalism which has dominated discussion of this story.|
|Initially misclassified as a vehicular hit-and-run, the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) opened a homicide investigation into Smith’s death shortly after the savage slayings of 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh and 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh on June 7, 2021 at Moselle – a 1,700-acre hunting property straddling the Salkehatichie River which until recently belonged to the Murdaugh family. Disbarred attorney Alex Murdaugh – a scion of this once-dominant legal dynasty – was convicted of those killings and sentenced to life in prison earlier this month.|
|Smith’s case has attracted international attention after it was prominently featured in the hit Netflix documentary, ‘Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal.’ What was the Murdaugh family’s connection to Smith’s death? It’s not immediately clear. According to 26-year-old Buster Murdaugh – who has been accused by many on social media of being involved in the crime – there is no connection. *“These baseless rumors of my involvement with Stephen and his death are false,”* Murdaugh said in a statement released earlier this month. *“I unequivocally deny any involvement in his death.”*|
|Others close to this story – including Smith’s mother, Sandy Smith – believe otherwise. In fact, Smith wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the fall of 2016 detailing the Murdaugh family’s alleged involvement.
*“The Murdaughs are probably the most prominent family in Hampton County,”* Smith wrote. *“Stephen had on more than one occasion mentioned to friends and his twin sister that he was involved romantically with someone from a prominent family in the county who was hiding his sexuality. He said it would shock people to know this person was gay. We suspect this could be the young man Stephen was referring to, though he never named him.”* |
|Sandy Smith’s letter was one of the first documents we published last week in our release of case files related to her son’s murder.|
|Speculation surrounding the Murdaugh family’s potential connection to Smith’s murder was certainly not occurring in a vacuum. The Murdaugh name was referenced on dozens of occasions in the original 2015 S.C. Highway Patrol (SCHP) “Multi-Disciplinary Accident Investigation Team” (MAIT) report into Smith’s death – another document we published last week. |
|Indeed, it was a review of this MAIT report in June of 2021 which prompted SLED to formally open an investigation into Smith’s murder. No new evidence or information was uncovered at the time, SLED agents simply concluded upon reading this report that Smith was not struck by a vehicle – and that his murdered body had been dumped in the middle of this rural Hampton County roadway. Subsequent investigations – by SLED and various private parties – have reaffirmed this conclusion. These inquiries have also pivoted the focus of the investigation away from immediate members of the Murdaugh family and toward other potential suspects. That does not mean, however, that the Murdaugh name is out of the mix.|
|Far from it …
|Two individuals currently viewed by SLED as persons of interest in connection with Smith’s death – Patrick Wilson and Shawn Connelly – were embroiled in various legal actions tied to the Murdaugh family in the months following the murder. As previously reported by this news outlet, on December 18, 2015 – five months after Smith’s murder – SCHP investigators received a tip from Wilson’s step-father, Darrell Williams of Varnville, S.C. According to Williams, his step-son informed him that Connelly – another Hampton County teenager – was driving a vehicle which *“struck and killed Stephen Smith.”* |
|Who told him to share this information? Randy Murdaugh – Alex Murdaugh’s older brother. According to case notes contained in the MAIT report, Williams *“stated that the reason he was passing this information on was because Randy Murdaugh told him to call.”* |
|Both Wilson and Connelly lived in the area near where Stephen Smith’s body was found … and there is information obtained by SLED investigators which has reportedly drawn a sharper focus on them as potential suspects. Several of these same leads were followed by producers and investigators associated with the Netflix documentary – as well as the initial legal team retained by Sandy Smith. In November of 2021, Charleston, S.C. attorney Andy Savage – who at the time was representing Smith’s family – gave an interview to WCIV TV-4 in which he indicated the Murdaughs were *“unconnected”* to Smith’s murder and any speculation that they were involved was *“unfounded.”* |
| *“There are suspects we have in sight that are unconnected to Murdaugh,”* Savage told reporters Anne Emerson and Drew Tripp. *“The focus any in the media have on Murdaugh may be unfounded.”*
Sandy Smith recoiled at that revelation – and parted ways with Savage shortly thereafter. Sources close to the investigation did not dispute Savage’s characterization, however. In fact, they hinted strongly that his assessment may have been accurate. Either way, the Murdaugh name still looms large over the case.|
|At the time of Wilson’s *“confession,”* he was facing attempted murder charges. Those charges were later dropped by the office of S.C. fourteenth circuit solicitor Duffie Stone – which employed Alex Murdaugh as a badge-carrying assistant solicitor at the time. Stone followed Murdaugh’s father, grandfather and great-grandfather into office – and *“served at the pleasure of the Murdaughs,”* according to one Hampton historian.|
|Meanwhile on August 7, 2015 – a month after Smith’s death – Randy Murdaugh filed a motor vehicle accident lawsuit against Connelly on behalf of his client, Christopher Still. Less than a year later – on May 17, 2016 – yet another Murdaugh attorney filed a separate motor vehicle accident lawsuit against Connelly. Both actions were later dismissed by Murdaugh-friendly judges in the fourteenth judicial circuit.|
|Along with SLED and others, this news outlet has continued to investigate these leads – which our law enforcement sources have described as the *“most promising”* related to their current inquiries. Over the course of the investigation, though, numerous rabbit holes were explored – as evidenced by the initial SCHP interviews we are publishing today.|
|The first file we are publishing is the SCHP interview with Stephen Smith’s twin sister – 26-year-old Stephanie Joyner. As noted in our prior coverage, Joyner was approached *“multiple times by peers”* who indicated the Murdaughs were somehow involved in her brother’s death.|
|Is that true? There is certainly a significant Murdaugh connection in her life today.|
|Joyner, readers will recall, has a child with Yemassee, S.C. police chief Greg Alexander – an alleged Murdaugh family *“fixer”* who is said to be the focus of an ongoing statewide grand jury investigation related to the family.|
|In her interview with SCHP officers, Joyner said Stephen Smith *“started coming home late”* in the days before his murder. *“Just this recent Monday, he didn’t come home until two o’clock in the morning,”* Joyner told SCHP corporal Michael Duncan on June 17, 2015, adding later on in the conversation that her brother had become *“more secretive”* in the weeks leading up to his death.|
|Joyner also told Duncan her brother had been involved in an *“incident”* at Bobcat Landing – a public boat access on the South Fork of the Edisto River just north of Bamberg, S.C. *“He got in an altercation there,”* Joyner said. *“Cops got called down and he was getting (in) an argument with somebody.”* That incident took place over the July 4 weekend – just days before Smith was murdered. Joyner denied that her brother – who was openly gay – was involved as a homosexual male escort, which was alleged by Smith’s purported boyfriend, Marc Bickhardt, in an interview with Duncan. According to Joyner, Smith “joked” about becoming an escort but *“never said he would actually do it.”*
*“I know for a fact Stephen wasn’t (in an escort service) because he never left the house like that,”* Joyner insisted, seeming to contradict her earlier statements regarding her brother *“coming home late”* and not returning home *“until two o’clock in the morning.”* Toward the end of her interview, Joyner admitted that during the last two weeks of her brother’s life she had no knowledge of where he was going or who he was seeing.|
|Readers will recall this news outlet reported weeks ago that Smith was engaged in what can charitably be described as *“high-risk behavior”* at the time of his death – including numerous illicit liaisons detailed in files extracted from at least one personal electronic device purportedly used by Smith (and in his possession) around the time of his death.|
|As previously reported, Smith told the SCHP investigator her son spent much of the weekend before he died with an individual linked closely to Alex Murdaugh and convicted fraudster Russell Laffitte – a Hampton, S.C. convenience store owner by the name of Kash Patel. *“The only people he talked about was he was hanging around … the guy named Kash,”* Sandy Smith told SCHP investigators during a July 17, 2015 interview. *“That was really his only friends in Hampton.”* Smith added that Patel and her son had taken a trip to Hilton Head Island shortly before his death. *“The guy named Kash that owns the (gas station) right there in Varnville,”* Smith continued. *“Stephen used to talk about him, they … they were all friends. It was a group of them and they would go have parties or something.”* |
|Patel was referenced by Laffitte in a February 24, 2022 deposition conducted by Amy Hill, a Columbia, S.C. attorney appointed to help oversee Murdaugh’s financial assets in connection with a pending civil case. According to Laffitte, he and Murdaugh would cash checks at the gas station owned by Patel’s family. *“If I needed $1,000 to cash at 10:00 (p.m.) at night, I’d say, hey, Kash, I need you to cash a check for me for $1,000,”* Laffitte said during the deposition. *“He would do it.”* |
|Sandy Smith echoed her daughters comments about Smith acting *“strange”* in the weeks leading up to his death – referring to him *“not studying”* and *“playing hooky”* from school. She also confirmed that Smith *“joked”* about *“going to be a stripper”* and going to *“work at an escort service to make money to pay for his school.”* |
|In addition to the interviews with his relatives, we are publishing an interview SCHP investigators conducted with David Uram of Hilton Head Island. Uram connected with Stephen Smith after seeing an ad Smith had placed on the website Craigslist. Smith came to Uram’s residence on Hilton Head Island on the evening of June 28, 2015 – arriving at approximately 10:30 p.m. EST and leaving at around *“one in the morning or something like that,”* according to the divorced father of one.|
| *“Was there any money exchanged?”* investigators asked.|
| *“No,”* Uram responded.|
| *“Okay, so it was just a … like a date?”* |
| *“Yes,”* Uram said. *“It was just a, how would you say it, consenting adult encounter. How’s that?”* |
|Uram later described the encounter as a *“one-night stand.”* *“We had, you know, a positive experience,”* he said. *“We both mutually enjoyed each other’s company.”* According to Uram, he texted Smith the following morning to make sure he got home safe. Smith responded that he *“had a good time”* with Uram and would be interested in meeting him again *“sometime in the future.”* *“I had texted him a couple of times after that which he never responded to – but maybe that’s because he was already passed away,”* Uram told the investigator.|
|Uram was contacted several weeks later by Sandy Smith, who told him she *“had a feeling that there was foul play involved”* in her son’s death. He told her about the Craigslist ads and advised her *“there are some crazy people out there”* who used the website. As for Smith’s murder, Uram told Sandy Smith he did not know what happened to her son but that it was a *“remote possibility that it might be somehow related”* to the ads he placed on Craigslist.|
|By far the most seismic of the interview files we are dropping today, though, is SCHP’s interview with Marc Bickhardt – who described himself to investigators as Smith’s boyfriend. Conducted by corporal Duncan on July 14, 2015 – less than a week after Smith’s murder – it contains perhaps the most vivid description of Smith’s final moments alive. According to Bickhardt, he spoke with Smith on the night of his murder and exchanged text messages with him as late as 3:37 a.m. EDT, less than half an hour before his body was found.|
| *“The last call I heard I asked him on one of the calls, ‘hey, are you walking?’ Because he already told me he was out of gas (on) one of the calls before,”* Bickhardt said. *“And I (said) are you walking because I hear cars going by and his answer to me was ‘no.’ And then the call dropped.”* |
|Bickhardt said Smith was supposed to see him that evening, but *“from what I’m learning he was headed home.”* |
|Smith never called Bickhardt back – and never responded to another text message. Bickhardt told investigators Smith *“sounded like he was drunk … he sounded like he was on something.”* Later, he added Smith said *“he felt he was being followed.”* |
| *“To be honest with you the next day I was upset with him because I had later on that day – I had a deep gut feeling something happened for the simple reason the phone wouldn’t … wouldn’t even take … it would go right to voicemail,”* Bickhardt told investigators. According to Bickhardt, he and Smith were reportedly arguing over posts made to Craigslist using provocative photographs. *“He has a lot of pictures of me – and I have a lot of pictures of him,”* Bickhardt said.|
|The pictures were supposed to have been deleted due to the fact Smith and Bickhardt had gotten *“serious”* about their relationship. *“We were about to get … we were gonna get married,”* Bickhardt said.|
|Midway through his interview, Bickhardt suggested *“the escort agency has something to do with this”* – referring to a Hilton Head Island-based service which reportedly employed Smith at the time of his death. Evidence of Smith’s escort work was reportedly stored on an iPad. *“I’m telling you the shit’s that’s going on is off that tablet,”* Bickhardt told investigators, adding later in the interview that Smith had an event planned with the agency that *“was supposed to be the whole weekend … he was going to take off school and everything.”* |
|Bickhardt further claimed Smith’s sister not only knew about his work as an escort – but helped him facilitate engagements. *“The sister has the tablet,”* Bickhardt said. *“(Stephen) told me the sister will do the calls and work a lot of it.”* |
|As the interview progressed, though, Bickhardt’s inability to recall dates and times began frustrating investigators – leading to some incredibly contentious exchanges (including moments where he and Duncan were literally screaming at each other). Bickhardt eventually told investigators that on the night he was murdered, Smith had mentioned *“a couple guys in (a) pickup truck”* – two *“rednecks”* who had allegedly harassed him at Snider’s Crossroads on Highway 63 between Walterboro and Varnville, S.C.|
|According to Bickhardt, Smith told him they were in a *“big truck”* with mud tires.|
| *“The last time we talked that night – before the phone went down – and I said to him, ‘are you walking or not?’ … I know at one point I heard big mud tires, big mud tires,”* Bickhardt said. *“They’re like coming toward him or going past because they sounded loud – and they were getting louder. And that, I believe was the last time I talked to him.”* |
|So what is the current status of the Smith investigation? As I noted above, SLED appears to have zeroed in on Wilson and Connelly as the top suspects in the investigation – which was recently assigned additional resources. As of this writing, investigators have declined to publicly exclude either Buster Murdaugh or the late Paul Murdaugh from their inquiries – despite multiple investigators telling this news outlet the agency has “proof” neither was involved in Smith’s murder.|
| *“SLED has proof the Murdaughs were not there at the time Stephen Smith was killed,”* a source close to the case told me. Rather than publicly exclude the Murdaughs – especially Buster Murdaugh – SLED issued a statement last week pushing back against reports that it *“cleared”* his statement last week proclaiming his innocence.|
| *“SLED did not approve or clear any statement made on behalf of Buster Murdaugh prior to its release,”* a statement from the agency noted. *“SLED was provided the statement five minutes prior to it being released to the media. As is our typical practice SLED has not released any information on potential suspects or persons of interest. The investigation into the death of Stephen Smith remains open and active.”* |

|Are there even more Murdaugh connections to this unsolved mystery?|
| Last week, this news outlet caused something of a stir when we posted our latest file drop from the ongoing murder investigation of Hampton, South Carolina teenager Stephen Smith – whose body was exhumed over the weekend from its resting place at Gooding Cemetery in Crocketville, S.C. Family attorney Ronnie Richter confirmed the exhumation of Smith’s body to reporter Riley Benson of WCBD TV-2 (NBC -Charleston, S.C.) late Saturday. Public information director Renée Wunderlich of the S.C. State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) – the agency overseeing the process – declined to comment.|
|Readers will recall this news outlet first called for the exhumation – and an independent review of controversial initial autopsy conclusions – over a year ago. *“Such a drastic step may be the only way to start uncovering the truth,”* I noted at the time. I am glad to see this process is finally underway …|
|SLED opened a homicide investigation into Smith’s death shortly after the savage slayings of 52-year-old Maggie Murdaugh and 22-year-old Paul Murdaugh on June 7, 2021 at Moselle – a 1,700-acre hunting property straddling the Salkehatichie River which until recently belonged to the Murdaugh family. |
|Disbarred attorney Alex Murdaugh – a scion of this once-dominant legal dynasty – was convicted of those killings and sentenced to life in prison earlier this month. What, exactly, is the Murdaugh connection to the case, though? That remains a mystery … but the family’s name has been all over the case from the beginning. As this news outlet reported last week, two individuals currently viewed by SLED as persons of interest in connection with Smith’s death – Patrick Wilson and Shawn Connelly – were embroiled in various legal actions tied to the Murdaugh family in the months following Smith’s murder. Not only that, it was a Murdaugh who pointed the finger at them in the first place.|
|On December 18, 2015 – five months after Smith’s murder – SCHP investigators received a tip from Wilson’s self-described step-father, Darrell Williams of Varnville, S.C. According to Williams, Wilson claimed that Connelly – another Hampton County teenager – was driving a vehicle which *“struck and killed Stephen Smith.”* |
|Who told him to share this information? According to the report, Randy Murdaugh – Alex Murdaugh’s older brother.|
|According to case notes contained in the MAIT report, Williams stated *“the reason he was passing this information on was because Randy Murdaugh told him to call.”*
On December 21, 2015, SCHP corporal Michael Duncan conducted an interview with Nick Ginn – who at the time was an officer with the Hampton, S.C. police department. Ginn has since been elected to Varnville town council. Duncan told Ginn that SCHP investigators had tried to contact Wilson but *“he avoided the call, the contact and all.”* According to Ginn, Williams relayed to him in a phone call in early December 2015 that Smith was struck by a vehicle – specifically, one of the side mirrors of Connelly’s truck. *“Basically, Darrell called me and he said, ‘Look … he said this is what I was told – he said Patrick (came) over here to the house … he told me that Shawn Connelly was drunk and hit something,’”* Ginn said. *“He said he went back the next day to see what it he had hit and he (saw) a lot of police out there. So he talked to one of the cops, and then he had left and then he learned – I guess by media – that somebody had been killed in that same area. That’s why the police were there.”* According to Ginn, Williams told him *“Shawn called (Wilson) crying, saying that that’s what had happened.”* Wilson was reportedly so distraught after retelling the story he became nauseated.|
|*“Patrick was crying telling him and after he got finished telling the story, he walked outside his house and threw up,”* Ginn said, referring to his conversation with Williams. This response convinced Williams that Wilson was telling the truth, according to Ginn. Ginn also told Duncan he believed Connelly had repaired damage to the mirror of his truck in the aftermath of Smith’s death. *“(Supposedly), he had fixed his mirror – he had patched one of the mirrors up on the truck,”* Ginn told Duncan. Asked by Duncan whether Wilson described how Smith was struck, he referred once again to the mirror. *“Supposedly it was the mirror,”* Ginn said, noting he had sent SCHP *“pictures of the truck that (Connelly)’s driving and he would have been driving that night.”* |
|Readers will recall Marc Bickhardt – who claimed to have been Smith’s boyfriend – said Smith had mentioned two *“rednecks”* in a pickup truck who had allegedly harassed him at Snider’s Crossroads on Highway 63 between Walterboro and Varnville, S.C. on the night he was murdered. According to Bickhardt, Smith claimed the two individuals who harassed him were riding in a *“big truck”* with mud tires. *“The last time we talked that night – before the phone went down – and I said to him, ‘are you walking or not?’ … I know at one point I heard big mud tires,”* Bickhardt said. *“Big mud tires. They’re like coming toward him or going past because they sounded loud – and they were getting louder. And that, I believe was the last time I talked to him.”* |
|So … would Smith being struck by the side mirror of a truck explain the absence of vehicular debris on the scene? Possibly … but how would it explain the location of Smith’s body in the middle of Sandy Run Road? Again, had Smith heard a truck (or any vehicle) approaching … wouldn’t he have moved to the side of the road?|
|SLED interviewed Ginn in the fall of 2021 – a few months after the agency launched its murder investigation. It is not immediately clear what information was obtained by agents during the course of this interview. Also, a private investigator working for Charleston, S.C. attorney Andy Savage – who was representing Stephen Smith’s family at the time – attempted to interview Ginn around the same time and was given a completely different story than the one he told investigators in December 2015. According to the private investigator – former U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agent Steven Peterson – Ginn recanted his prior statements about Connelly, the truck mirror and the pictures he purportedly provided to SCHP. *“Ginn denied all of that when I spoke with him,”* Peterson said.|
|Meanwhile, Williams reportedly changed his story as well – telling Peterson he *“never said anything about Randy Murdaugh telling him to go to the police about Patrick Wilson.”* Whatever happened, there remain multiple Murdaugh connections to both Wilson and Connelly. As previously noted, at the time of Wilson’s “confession” he was facing attempted murder charges – charges which were later dropped by the office of S.C. fourteenth circuit solicitor Duffie Stone. As our regular readers are well aware, Stone followed Murdaugh’s father, grandfather and great-grandfather into office and *“served at the pleasure of the Murdaughs,”* according to one Hampton historian. Stone also employed Alex Murdaugh as a badge-carrying assistant solicitor at the time Smith was murdered.|
|Adding a layer of suspicion? Wilson was represented in his attempted murder case by none other than Cory Fleming of Beaufort, S.C.
Fleming is currently facing eighteen criminal counts including conspiracy, breach of trust, money laundering, computer crimes and obtaining property by false pretenses in connection with a scheme to defraud insurers following the 2018 death of Murdaugh family housekeeper Gloria Satterfield. Alex Murdaugh is facing a dozen charges in connection with the same scheme. Fleming also accompanied Murdaugh to SLED headquarters in Walterboro, S.C. in August of 2021 for his third (and final) interview with investigators probing the Moselle double homicide.|
|S.C. circuit court judge Clifton Newman is expected to set a trial date for the Satterfield charges soon. As if these connections weren’t sufficient to raise eyebrows, on August 7, 2015 – a month after Smith’s death – Randy Murdaugh filed a motor vehicle accident lawsuit against Connelly on behalf of his client, Christopher Still. Less than a year later – on May 17, 2016 – another Murdaugh attorney filed a separate motor vehicle accident lawsuit against Connelly.|
|Both actions were later dismissed by Murdaugh-friendly judges in the fourteenth judicial circuit. Were these cases being used as leverage? And if so, to what end?|
|Let me be clear: I am not saying Connelly and/ or Wilson killed Smith – accidentally or otherwise. Nor am I saying they were being positioned as patsies by the powerful Murdaugh family following the crime (perhaps in the hopes of deflecting attention from something more sinister). All I know is SLED has reportedly zeroed in on Connelly and Wilson *“as the top suspects in the investigation”* as the agency brings additional resources to bear on this crime. Also, according to our law enforcement sources, at least one of these ‘persons of interest’ attempted to manufacture an alibi regarding their whereabouts on the evening Smith was murdered – which is obviously a major red flag.|
|And one of the reasons for the added scrutiny … Hopefully Smith’s exhumation will yield useful evidence for investigators as they try to piece together what happened on that fateful evening nearly eight years ago on Sandy Run Road.|
| **April 3, 2023** |
| **[$35,000 reward offered for information into Stephen Smith’s 2015 death](https://www.postandcourier.com/murdaugh-updates/35-000-reward-offered-for-information-into-stephen-smiths-2015-death/article_7e7789c2-d256-11ed-8d95-b30763589f57.html)** |
|HAMPTON — The mother of Stephen Smith — the teen found dead nearly eight years ago in the middle of a Hampton County road — is offering a reward for more information regarding her son’s final hours. Attorneys representing Sandy Smith announced April 3 the family will pay $35,000 for information leading to an arrest in Stephen Smith’s July 2015 death. In making the announcement, the Bland Richter Law Firm urged anyone with information to contact the State Law Enforcement Division.|
|*“We understand that providing information about a crime can be difficult, and we want to support the community however we can bring closure for the Smith family,”* attorneys Eric Bland and Ronnie Richter said in a joint statement. The announcement is another chapter in a case that has garnered national attention through its links to the Murdaugh saga.|
|It comes on the heels of Smith’s body being exhumed over the April 1 weekend in order for an independent autopsy to be conducted. The exhumation was subsidized with money collected from a GoFundMe drive aimed at raising $15,000. The effort surpassed that goal by collecting nearly $120,000. Bland Richter said the reward money will come from that pool.|
|Stephen Smith’s death along Sandy Run Road was initially declared by a state medical examiner to be a hit-and-run, and no arrests were made. Officials then pivoted, saying there was no evidence to support that cause of death and began to investigate it as a homicide. The case was reviewed along with others in the wake of the June 2021 murders of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh at their estate in Colleton County. SLED said it was reassessing Smith’s death *“based upon information gathered during the course of the double-murder investigation.”* |
|That prompted Sandy Smith to launch her GoFundMe account to have her son’s body exhumed and examined, this time by an independent examiner.|
